# Classification with Keras CV

Classification is the process of predicting a categorical label for a given input image. 

To get started with image classification using KerasCV, you can follow the structured approach outlined in the guide. 

The process is broken down into three levels of complexity:

1. Inference with a pretrained classifier

2.  Fine-tuning a pretrained backbone

3.  Training a image classifier from scratch
