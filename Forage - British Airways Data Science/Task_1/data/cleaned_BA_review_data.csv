Jonathan Rodden,"✅Trip Verified|  Flew British Airways on BA 434 London Heathrow to Amsterdam. I was able to check in at the BA First Class check in area in Terminal 5 and this is very fast and efficient. The lounge was quite busy; however, I was able to find space. The food, snacks, and drinks available was excellent as was the overall service. I also like the BA First Class Check in area as the security clearance is fast. Boarding was a little chaotic, however we boarded on time and the take off runway was close to the departing gate, therefore no delays.

D Baker,"✅Trip Verified| I strongly advise everyone to never fly British Airways. I know we will never do so again. We had business class seats booked for an early morning flight from Heathrow to SF - and then the flight was cancelled the evening before the flight. We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home. She also said these problems were common with BA.",1.0,10.0,"“never fly British Airways""",2024-06-06,Boeing 747,Business,Business Class,Heathrow to San Francisco,2024-06,no,Heathrow , San Francisco
S Barton,"✅Trip Verified|  I should like to review my flight with British Airways from Hannover to London Heathrow. Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism. This experience has turned around my less than positive experience with this airline a few months ago. Well done to the ground staff and cabin crew for making this a pleasant and civilized journey!",9.0,10.0,“a pleasant and civilized journey”,2024-06-01,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hannover to London Heathrow,2024-05,yes,Hannover , London Heathrow

L Tomlinson,"✅Trip Verified|  A premium price for a sub-par product - flew BA (031/032) LHR and HKG and return in May. We had originally booked when the aircraft was allocated the club suites - paid for seat selection. A couple of months prior to the trip, the aircraft was changed to the 2/3/2 layout with the yin/yang seat configuration. We had been allocated 2 of the 3 middle seats, so paid again to select the window and aisle. The hard product is poor - the seat space lacks any form of storage that remains accessible when the seat is in the flat position - nowhere to put specs, a book or phone. Additionally, the window seat passenger has to climb over the feet of another passenger to use the toilet etc - really poor layout. The planes on both legs of the journey were tired and shabby. The crew on the outward journey were enthusiastic and helpful - the return crew seemed less adept at managing the service. The outbound catering was acceptable - but the presentation on tiny plates does not compare favourably with competitors. The catering inbound was very poor. The welcome ‘champagne’ was truly awful. This is a poor product at a premium price - and sad to say, this pair of self-funding passengers won’t choose to repeat the experience. The lounge at Heathrow on the outbound sector was packed to the rafters and was a poor experience.

E Burton,"✅Trip Verified|  LHR - SFO, LAS - LGW August 2023 in Club World. It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months!

R Bartelo,"✅Trip Verified|  Milan to Miami return via London. Worst business class ever. The layout of A380 of BA is crazy. The width of seats is outrageous (aisle seats are a shame for BA). Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That’s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above).

A Ahmed,"✅Trip Verified|  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!",4.0,10.0,"""replicating the likes of Ryanair""",2024-05-07,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Catania to Gatwick,2024-05,no,Catania , Gatwick
Anders Pedersen,"✅Trip Verified|  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier.

Ezra Tan,"✅Trip Verified|  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a ""service recovery"" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation.

G Reyes,"✅Trip Verified|  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers.

E Dodson,"✅Trip Verified|  This is the first time I have seen the new Club World suite. The seat was comfortable but unlike other airlines, BA has crammed as many seats in business class as is humanly possible so the cabin felt cramped. The crew behaved as though we, the passengers, should have been grateful for them turning up for their shift. They looked scruffy in the new uniforms, clearly the dress code policy has been scrapped. I appreciate that appearance is no measure of service quality (in the UK alone) but the service was appalling. The menu lacked choice and the food was presented as if it fell to the floor and was scooped back onto the plate. The bedding was atrocious, an old scraggly blanket and I’ll fitting seat cover. I was cold and asked for an extra blanket which never arrived. There were no drinks coasters (obviously cutbacks) so my drinks kept spilling. I decided to clean up myself as the crew couldn’t be bothered and didn’t pick up on the fact I was using bathroom hand towels to act as drinks coasters to mop up the mess. The aircraft was old (although retrofitted) and had a leak by the galley wall with lots of blue roll in situ to mop up the mess.

I ordered waffles for breakfast and they looked like they’d fallen off the plate and had been thrown back on (see photo). The plate that the waffles were served on was so hot that when I moved the plate I burnt my finger. I wasn’t warned that it was ferociously hot. I was shocked at how bad the food presentation was, but didn’t feel comfortable saying anything to the cabin crew as she wasn’t approachable or friendly.

C Down,"✅Trip Verified|  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad.

Troy Robinson,"✅Trip Verified| A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass.

On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable.

N Wardan,"✅Trip Verified|  We had a really good flying experience with BA, travelling as a young family of 4. The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process.

First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board.

During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits.

So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet.

V Simpson,"✅Trip Verified| Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost.

C Horner,"✅Trip Verified|  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use.

On our return flight ATL/LHR we skipped the evening meal preferring to sleep and were looking forward to a hearty breakfast prior to arrival at LHR. Sadly we were seriously disappointed.

Greg Zarelli,"cNot Verified|  I had hoped this would be a good review but unfortunately it won’t be. I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa.

B Jackson,"✅Trip Verified| Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes.",8.0,10.0,“Much better experience this time around”,2023-12-14,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Cape Town to London Heathrow,2023-12,yes,Cape Town , London Heathrow

S Horton,"✅Trip Verified|   The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice, and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly. Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers.

There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status.

I used the BA website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect.

There was no in-flight entertainment. The seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight. The lack of catering was overt. Other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible “breakfast bar” one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too. The passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault. Moreover, the USB charge points did not work either. Given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service. The system BA have in place is not good enough. The flight arrived on-time. The disembarkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen. The crew were wearing the new BA uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline. To be candid, there was any difference between this BA service and that of so-called “budget” rivals.

M Dale,"✅Trip Verified|   I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years. Having noted the ratings given, frankly, I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service. In a nutshell, BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation. This fact was hammered home on my return leg, which was not in Club Europe. Quite alarmingly, BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its ""Business Class"" seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency. I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen. Short-haul business (Club Europe) is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for lounge/pre-boarding benefits. While cabin crew service is excellent, the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices, etc. places them a million 'air'miles behind competing airlines, such as Qatar, Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality. BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers - really?

The seat, with sliding double doors was spacious, well designed and very comfortable.  British Airways offered a solid First Class service, from Concorde Lounge to boarding (which was actually by group number for a change) to the very warm and genuine welcome on boarding.

Kane Kelly,"Not Verified|  Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them. Do not give them your money, they cant even look after their staff let alone customers.

This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year.

Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left.

How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off.

The fact that as a Business Class customer BA pays the minimum they can get away with says it all - they couldn't care less about customers, have no interest in loyalty and aren't bothered about your business.

Pradeep Madhavan,"✅Trip Verified|  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them.",4.0,10.0,"""Things have really deteriorated""",2023-07-09,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chennai to London,2023-07,no,Chennai , London

It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments.

Alastair Cockburn,"✅Trip Verified|  24 hours before our departure on BA059 to Cape Town from Heathrow on Thursday 29th June, we did an online check-in. Seats had already been allocated for my wife and I - 41 E and F - which are the middle two seats of the central block of four. These were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and getting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet would mean climbing over a person on the aisle. But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person. The breakfast Spanish Omelette was, however, not bad at all. The previous day we had flown economy from Malta to Heathrow on Malta Airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure.

Ralph Tuckwell,"Not Verified|  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience.

R Vines,"✅Trip Verified|  This is a two-for-one review covering economy and business class on the BA flight from London City to Ibiza. Economy was excellent. A very light lunch (small cheese-and-pastrami sandwich, chocolate brownie) followed by a pretty much free-flowing drinks trolley. The flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job. This is a flight I would recommend. Except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business. I didn't eat, so I paid £100 for nothing. Oh well.

Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting. Finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous, but they provide a very trimmed down, budget airline type service, as the whole trip turned out to be - and yet this business class ticket was one of the more expensive on recent trips.

Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times.

C Peale,"✅Trip Verified|  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out.

G Jones,"Not Verified| Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better.

Andrew Pybus,"✅Trip Verified|  Obviously many airlines have gone downhill in recent years. Prices have increased and services have gone down. The most disappointing thing about BA is that aspects that really don’t need to get worse have. The check in staff at Heathrow are downright rude and abusive, shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers get confused with the constant shouting and bullying. Airlines are now competing globally more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in Asia where the service industry is next level. I wouldn’t want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful.

Sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines. At booking time, one is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat. At Heathrow T5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at bag drop curt to say the least. The lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and BA has not invested in them for many years. On the flight the food was okay, although portions are kept minimal. This was one of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight.

C Down,"✅Trip Verified| Boarding at Mumbai was chaotic and badly organised. Once on board the crew announcements were professional, relaxed and informative in typical BA style. The seat was quite comfortable. It was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good. I was lucky that the middle seat was empty so I didn’t suffer from the new narrow seat which I think would have made it a lot less comfortable. The IFE is excellent, responsive and good quality. There is an enormous selection of TV and movies and a good number of games. WIFI is also very good not quite Netflix quality but still reasonable and I don’t think £17.99 for full flight is bad value. You can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging. Cabin crew were very good. Friendly and efficient. Catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight, the small (but tasty) pastry for the second meal service wasn’t really enough. Landing and processing at Heathrow was astonishingly quick - it felt like it was 3am, even though it was 6:30pm! No queues or waiting at all. Even the baggage was super quick at coming through.

Pieter Boone,"Not Verified| Mexico City Airport is a zoo, but taking the late departure on BA to LHR isn't too bad. Club passengers can use the AA Admirals Lounge, which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to BA's club passengers only at this time of day. Lovely staff, solid food & bar, really pleasant. We flew an older 787 with the old style club seats. Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey...

I was quite comfortable, however, the first leg of the flight from Mumbai to Heathrow, the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest. The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim.

Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option.

C Barton,"✅Trip Verified|  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight.

G Jackson,"✅Trip Verified| Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating.

At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10.

The check-in staff at the Club Europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service.  The Galleries South Lounge was very busy, but the food was very good. There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues. The A321 featured Wi-Fi which contains a very good landing page with flight information, access to the Speedbird Cafe menu, access to BA.com, and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also.

P Marten,"✅Trip Verified|  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew.

I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again.

Bedding and large pillow supplied. Attentive FA's - especially Anna who addressed me by name). However, let down by very average catering (not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife). And, sadly, once again a very poor choice of films on the IFE which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen.

L Pulliam,"Not Verified|  DFW-LHR. Had an easy transfer at DFW from American Airlines to British Airways heading to London. First ride on an A380 left me with the feeling that this plane type won't ever be my first choice. Was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy, but the seats and rows were very cramped. When the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and I had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen. The seat itself wasn't too bad but I felt squished and locked in. On a plus side, having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side. Ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice. Plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night. Dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre-landing snack. The entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies, tv, music and games.

L Tran,"✅Trip Verified| The check-in process was smooth. I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation.",3.0,10.0,"""I still found it underwhelming""",2022-09-25,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to London Heathrow,2022-09,no,Istanbul , London Heathrow

Michael Little,"✅Trip Verified|  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris.

The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good.

Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago).

S Gray,"Not Verified|  Feels like BA are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. Very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew. However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative.

Daniel Cook,"✅Trip Verified|  Recent trip to Boston, departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere.

The connecting flight from LHR - MAN was cancelled with no contact from the airline, I only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs, with no alternative flight provided. We had to privately book a taxi from LHR to Manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train.

Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the ""leftovers"", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg.

The messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent. The food was first class, nothing was too much for the staff. Why, oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service? My thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company.

However that was seven weeks ago and no Avios points have been added to my account, I have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department, when the phone was answered I was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number I was calling!

Nicholas Coveyduck,"✅Trip Verified|  The short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for. We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal.

After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes.

The aircraft was better than the outbound flight, who screen was so small. After serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin, no first choice. Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered. With only 90 minutes between my connecting flight, due to late arrival, I made staff aware. Whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first, there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight. It was a struggle to get my connecting flight.

David Ellis,"✅Trip Verified| The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean.

David Ellis,"✅Trip Verified| Boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air-con at the gate. The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets.

T Rigby,"Not Verified|  Utterly appalling company. We've flown with them two times now, and both times it's been a disaster. The first time: Return flight was delayed by over 24 hours. There was nobody at the gate to tell us this, so a large group of passengers had to roam round Dubai airport looking for BA staff. There were none. Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms. We were given a terrible, dirty, cramped room. Several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved. Eventually we got to board the next day. My tray table was broken, as was the window blind, and I didn't get a meal. No compensation was offered. The second time I need to reschedule my flight. The website assured me this was fine, but provided no link. I needed to phone up. If you need to phone BA, don't even bother trying. I never got to speak to anyone, and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling. The food has been terrible, meagre portions given infrequently.

Ken Howie,"✅Trip Verified|  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested.

R Teel,"✅Trip Verified|  In Glasgow one check in desk open. Huge queue with no business check in. It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again.

David Ellis,"✅Trip Verified| After two years of being unable to fly to our second home in South Africa because of COVID, it was fantastic to be back on board a BA flight to CPT, and in the Club Suite seats (1K and 2K) to boot. These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time.

To add to my previous review, I really like how BA organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups, this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers don’t jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there. The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed.

Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback.

Arthur Moore,"✅Trip Verified|  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all.

Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment.

Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. For the fare I would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference. We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue.

Oliver White,"Not Verified|  What has happened to British Airways? The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that!

Andy Magowan,"✅Trip Verified|  I’ve been flying with BA for years and never had any issues. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers.

Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the £5,727 that BA charges for this route.

Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service.

He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn’t see them.

As this was my 100th flight, I decided to celebrate it in Club Europe, which turned out to be a perfect decision. The stewards working in Club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty. Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn’t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways.

So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there.

A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck.

Chaos at Chicago as most passengers had American issued boarding passes for the BA flight to London and BA weren't accepting those boarding passes. No explanation for the change in policy.

Breakfast a little small but tasty. I even got a 2nd cup of tea! Journey smooth with some sleep. I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client's data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on.

R Bowen,"✅Trip Verified|  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient.

R Gannon,"✅Trip Verified|  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. And bear in mind I was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.",5.0,10.0,"""roller coaster of incompetence""",2020-01-28,Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,San Diego to Stockholm via London,2020-01,no,San Diego , Stockholm via London

Ishan Pai,"✅Trip Verified|  Mumbai to Boston via London. My flight with British airways was really good. The catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good. However, some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the IFE box blocking space in front of you. Also, BA had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in. They have a really weird policy that you can't carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead, you have to check it in. The ground staff was rude at Logan Airport in Boston. Also, they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in Boston 24 hrs after I had come. Even after contacting BA'S Baggage Customer Service, they were speaking rudely to me. They always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern.

M Larson,"✅Trip Verified|  Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines.",7.0,10.0,"""still consider other airlines""",2020-01-22,Boeing 787 / A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Geneva via London,2020-01,yes,Toron, to Geneva via London

Instead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing.

The flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers, they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off.

Fantastic flight. Travelled solo from London Gatwick to Glasgow in British Airway’s Club Europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service.

The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked Salmon served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely flying experience.

I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service.

David Ellis,"✅Trip Verified|  Johannesburg to London. The recently refurbished First and Club World lounge at JNB has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to LHR descend on it. There's more table space for eating and the food has improved, but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy. Crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity. Boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues. The predominantly young, mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled. The meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course. The food itself wasn't at all bad - when it was finally served. The cabin temperature wasn't too hot and we both slept quite well. Arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick.

Leaving London we had a chicken stir fry and landing into Singapore at 18:00 we were served an English breakfast which I can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd. At Singapore, all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean. When re-boarding you had to go through a security check at the gate.

D Jonas,"✅Trip Verified| London to New York JFK. We were booked on Brussels Airlines, two of us, which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on BA. The flight BRU to London was fine but the transatlantic leg and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were utter nightmares. Never again will I go to or through Heathrow. However, this review is about BA's 747-400 to JFK an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago. How does BA have the gall to call its service ""business class""? The seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions. Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent.

A Ward,"✅Trip Verified|  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing.",3.0,10.0,"""the shortage of staff""",2019-12-04,Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Bridgetown,2019-12,no,Gatwick , Bridgetown
Everardus Hamans,"✅Trip Verified|  Brussels to Bangkok via London. Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats 15C and 15D. It was a Boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I’m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go.

David Ellis,"Not Verified|  London to Johannesburg with British Airways. BA’s B gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the Galleries Lounges in the main terminal. It’s also a tad closer on the transit - or via the rather useful walkway on level -4 - to the C gates where the A380s depart from. The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films. The dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. Trolleys may lack glamour, but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight.

J Cohlen,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Vancouver. I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone’s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only.

C Irving,"✅Trip Verified| Tirana to London Gatwick. I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well.

O Robins,"✅Trip Verified| London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update!

The flight was 7 hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort. The little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting. If the seat in front of you reclines, as they invariably do, there is even less room. Shameful. The food was below average as well, even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food. I will never fly British Airways again. 0 stars. Beware.

The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars!

It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of £4.99 for an hour's use.

M Irving,"✅Trip Verified| Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.",9.0,10.0,"""the value was very good""",2019-09-21,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel,2019-09,yes,London Heathrow , Berlin Tegel

The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course).

J. Knopf,"Not Verified|  London to Johannesburg. British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other.

A Norton,✅Trip Verified| London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. This was a very similar experience outbound and inbound. I am sure the plane was the same. I am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen BA. I am seriously considering not doing this again. The 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old. I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. That time at least we received AVIOS.

K Lee,"✅Trip Verified| Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route.

David Worten,"✅Trip Verified|  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible.

R Sanyal,"✅Trip Verified| New York to Glasgow via London. A routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7). I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous.

Tony McLaughlin,"✅Trip Verified|  BA 2616 and 2617 return trip from Gatwick to Cagliari. Both flights on a Saturday and were full. Aircraft was an A320-200 on both legs. Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful. You are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to. Also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley, and they would not return to their seats. The rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land. Outbound flight was fine, Inbound flight was not a great advertisement for BA.

S Warden,"✅Trip Verified|  I had some difficulty from the start, after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in, even though I was already logged in. I wanted to reserve seats and request special meals. It took me 2 days to achive this. I was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats, no extra legroom, this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the LHR-KUL and return KUL-LHR legs. I had difficulty checking in using the BA app and eventually did it using Malaysia Airlines app. Checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in Kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference. I was looking forward to flying on the Boeing 787 but it really is just a dream. Food choices we were told ran out at breakfast, the choice was full English or just an omelette, but the full English ran out or so we were told, but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full English on it. Earlier meals were ok with beer, wine and other drinks available. There was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water. For an over 12h flight, I think the cabin should at least be visited 2-3 times. Toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy. The IFE selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music.

T Reid,"✅Trip Verified|  Belfast City to Atlanta via London Heathrow T5. Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.",5.0,10.0,"""I might fly them again""",2019-06-07,A319 / Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Belfast  to Atlanta via London,2019-04,no,Belfast  , Atlanta via London

The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology.

Boarding by group number worked effectively and I was able to store my laptop in the overhead. Free newspapers were available in the jet way. Passengers were warmly greeted.

Usual on board trolley service which I didn't use. Flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in Linate 20 minutes late.

The cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer - outstanding.

Ken Howie,"✅Trip Verified|  The connecting flight to Johannesburg was on an older 737-400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom. Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds.

David Ellis,"✅Trip Verified| CPT is definitely getting its act together: BA's Galleries Lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once. The upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in Club World. That's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny IFE screen with appalling resolution. The new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious. The dinner service was according to the new CW 'soft' design, which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually. On the whole, I think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it, rather than served with the dessert. Breakfast has been streamlined, too, and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff.

Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing.

C Down,"✅Trip Verified|  Gatwick to Malaga. Check in was fairly quick. The check in area at Gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep. The whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets. If you’re not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring. The lounge at Gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy, there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit. The food and drink offering was very good. Tasty and varied. On board I was lucky to be able to book the exit row, which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion. Food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasn’t a problem for me. The food offering is fairly poor really, a couple of sandwiches or snacks.. drinks selection is better. What was very nice was, near the end of the flight I was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member. I wouldn’t expect this, and I’m sure it’s just because they had a bottle to use up, but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers. Still no WiFi or WiFi based in flight entertainment offered. Priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant. My bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags.

Was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the Window. Seat itself was the standard one, comfortable. The boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft. There was never a massive crowd in front of the gate. The inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal. The food was very mediocre at best - not worth losing sleep over it. There was serious bumps along the way midflight. The A380 being so massive easily absorbed it. Return was on a B777 - flight was not full but almost full. The inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey. The baggage drop area however was a disaster. None of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers. The boarding was again very orderly.

Still, unfortunately, a 30 year-old 747 that hadn't had its refurbishment and was showing its age.

I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist.

P Merton,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Shanghai. The most disappointing business class I have flown in a long time. The plane was old, worn and dirty (there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight), It took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off - the food followed shortly, which was over cooked. They seemed to be short on staff. However, what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before I’d even been offered a drink. The service was exceptionally poor. I am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight. As a Gold card holder, you might have thought BA would check their frequent fliers are being looked after? I’ll return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips, such as Cathay, JAL or Finnair.

H Warner,"✅Trip Verified|  St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA’s latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called ‘Salvation’ and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it.

The flight was 5 hours long-so this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable - worse than a budget airline. A midnight arrival at Heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a ""balance problem"". In addition I was incorrectly charged Eur 75 on the return leg for my case - it was clearly the same case that I travlled out to Cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage. Cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers.

S Beale,"✅Trip Verified|  Gatwick to St Lucia return. Recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in Caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration. Tickets bought in August 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a Club Class return, having flown out Premium Economy. Arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to Premium Economy due to overbooking. Apologetic ground staff (defending the indefensible) but no apology on the plane. Fuming all the way back to London, exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service (tea when I asked for coffee) and filthy food. Complained on return through BA exec Club webiste with response from Customer Service 10 days later. BA claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology. Evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season. We booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats. BA has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder. General quality of BA service, food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years. BA is now effectively a low cost airline, flying a fleet of very tired aircraft, trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline. The accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet. Avoid this airline if you possible can.

The seating of these newer planes allows me knee room, even though I'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too. The entertainment system, though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of Cathay Pacific, nevertheless had a good range of movies and TV to watch. Both flights ended up arriving on time, despite delays at Heathrow both ways, and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on. Food quality was reasonable, again not up to the standard of Cathay Pacific, rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which I thought was a bit mean.

London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6"" of leg room behind row ""1"". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. ""Build value guys"" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap.

There is no lumbar support. The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It’s really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job.

D Gold,"✅Trip Verified|  Chicago to London Heathrow. Club Class on British Airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry.  It is bad enough that BA persist using out of date airplanes, circa 25 year old B747-400's, but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of Club Class, where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you, and raise a screen for privacy. Then, mid-flight the crew lower the screen to serve the food. To leave the seat, one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark. The crew from Chicago were appalling, and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible. Breakfast was inedible, and I returned it uneaten. The lounge at O'Hare was a crowded, tiny, dirty facility, with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese. Insufficient chairs, and a single, old TV. Does no one at BA care how BAD they have become for premium class passengers.",1.0,10.0,"""out of date airplanes""",2019-02-26,B747-400,Business,Business Class,Chicago to London Heathrow,2019-02,no,Chicago , London Heathrow
D Gold,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Chicago. Could it get any worse? The flight to Chicago was equipped with the usual ancient Boeing 747-400. The British Airways First Class product doesn't come up to modern Business Class standards. This particular flight was late again, and the food / wine was simply awful. There is nothing remotely elegant about BA First Class, and the crew demonstrate no sophistication. This experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain. Finally, not only is the aircraft tired and worn out, but the in flight so-called entertainment system did not work, and had to be rebooted twice. The First Class seat is a bad joke, and extraordinarily uncomfortable. British Airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire First Class product. All that can be said about this airline is woeful.

B Stauffer,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Johannesburg. Since the aircraft was half full, I was looking for a great flight. We left on time, and that was the only positive point. I started watching a movie, and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice. I told her that I would love a G&T to start with, and then I will read the menu. She told me that this was a late evening departure (9pm is not late for me) and that no pre-dinner drinks would be served. I insisted (this is business class after all, half full flight). 30 minutes later, she brought a tray with everything on it (G&T, first dish, main dish, and dessert).  Never was I offered wine or coffee. The lights were turned off, and I did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing.

David Taylor,"✅Trip Verified|  Doha to London Heathrow. Flight on time, not completely full, had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way. Some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane. Breakfast was served which was OK. Cabin crew mixed, mostly young and worked quickly. Crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world. There is good and bad still with BA - bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival - leathery and inedible - why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering - hardly any passengers near me could eat it.

The cabin is stylish and intimate and I was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were. The entertainment system was working well (although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying). I was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming. My only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available. A similar thing happened with breakfast, three options, the third being the most appetizing, and no, it hadn't been loaded, so this is an area BA might want to look into.

G Beele,"✅Trip Verified|  My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them.

L Beale,"✅Trip Verified|  Tokyo to London. I was looking forward to this flight because of the Club World ticket and because it was my first time flying on a Boeing 787. We had a good check-in experience, breezed through the airport and enjoyed the JAL Lounge at Narita. We boarded on time and first impressions of the Boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded. The food and wines were really good. I had a beautifully-presented Japanese starter followed by a bento-style lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options. There was plenty of choice on the IFE and there was a big screen. On the downside, the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight. This was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too. The seat was comfortable and reclined fully but I find the layout of BA Club World a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle. The cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming. The context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to Tokyo. We had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew.

We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE.

Fortunately, we still managed to take off more or less on time. The cabin crew responsible for our side of the First cabin was personable but lacked experience. The food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre. Warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience. The seats in First are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin. The duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin. One of the First toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the Club World loos upstairs.

The IFE was passable and the sound quality good if one's own noise cancelling headphones are used. WiFi was available but I didn't make use of it.

The 2-3-2 seating in the front section of Club World on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers. A full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in First. The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats.

R Barsat,"✅Trip Verified|  Newark to Bangalore return via London on BA premium economy (World Traveler Plus). I paid about 40% more for premium economy (about $600 extra) so approximately $150 per leg. Was it worth it? I'd say broadly yes, though I wouldn't want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 6-7 hours was involved. Before Boarding: Premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 (and India to US/Canada is one of those exceptions though it isn't clear if it applies for travel originating at either end). So I am not sure if I got an extra bag or not but I did use the 2 bag allowance Boarding: You board in Zone 3 after First/Business & the oneworld elites. That is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage - if it doesn't fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding. This means you also get off fairly quickly - which can help if you're in a hurry to get through security at Heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination. In Flight: There is a welcome drink for premium economy (champagne, juice, water depending on the departure time). There is also a hot towel service also. 787 cabin: The 787-9 has a nicely done premium economy cabin. 2-3-2 seating as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. So a somewhat wider seat. Seat pitch is also decent. These are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats - but seat was comfortable. The food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage (though not much). There is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor. There is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf. You do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades, socks and toothpaste. The seat back screen is large and easy to use. There is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy - so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2-4-2 seating in premium economy (same as club world) as opposed to 3-3-3 in economy. The 777 version used on the LHR-BLR sector has a very small premium economy cabin - just 3 rows of seats. This gives it a sort of cosy feel. You do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom. Economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full - and I had the seat next to me vacant on both legs. That helped me stretch out for sure. The seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats. Food: Nothing much here. I didn't think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been. It was OK - nothing to write home about. All in all, for such a long journey, the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage. Worth it on extra long haul like US to India. Bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs.",7.0,10.0,"""offer some additional comfort""",2019-01-07,Boeing 787-9 / 777,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Newark to Bangalore via London,2018-12,yes,Newark , Bangalore via London
Owen Berkeley-Hill,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Mumbai. I have had my battles with the leadership at BA because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their Airmiles. Now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn Airmiles through their credit cards. This is just to illustrate that I boarded BA199 with a slightly negative mindset, a mindset which was changed quickly. Although I travelled Economy, the seat was comfortable, the service excellent, as was the food. If I have a minor quibble, the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old. Is this BA's attempt to reduce costs, because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product. I was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single-use plastic (e.g. water bottles, duty-free carrier bags) into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine.

H Neale,"✅Trip Verified|  Our return journey from Sydney to London, which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at Singapore airport, was faced with one major issue. We flew economy class with a two year old, whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasn’t working. Having paid £723 for our two year olds ticket, you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight. Having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed. We were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical. The cabin crew gave us some First Class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25. They said they would contact BA customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us. By the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim, I had already received an email from BA C/S and that they would respond within 48 hours, which they did. However, all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another BA flight. I replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said. I also said I had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an eVoucher is worthless to me. There was no other alternative or any means of reasoning. The flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable.

Pawornprach Pakdeeteva,"✅Trip Verified| I had flown British Airways from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow as a part of my journey back home (Thailand) on the 12th December 2018. I arrived at Leeds Bradford 3 hours early so there wasn't a queue at the check-in counter. Check-in process took less than a minute as I already done online check-in, this means I just dropped my luggage. The staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful. I passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft. Boarding process is a mess as there wasn't priority boarding (I flew economy) and no boarding groups, luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door (as the aircraft parked on a remote stand). The aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean. The seat was comfortable and had a good wing view. The only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short (luckily I was only 176m tall so this wasn't a problem). The aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition, but the crew were very friendly and very helpful. The captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information. As the flight departed the crew started on board service. I didn't buy anything as the food option was poor, expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards. It was one hour flight so I didn't expect the top service standard. The flight arrived at London Heathrow on time despite some traffic.

Peter Driscoll,"Not Verified|  Gatwick to Tenerife. This aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring! G-MEDK is by far the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. I paid extra for an extra leg room seat - 12A because I always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight. I reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal. It was like sitting on concrete! I would imagine that when this aircraft was new (2005 I believe) the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding, it was dreadful. I took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in Lanzarote which, coupled with there being no passengers next to me, made the flight in 11F a little more bearable. Staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time I returned at night ten days later. I normally travel Easyjet on this route but on this occasion, I used some Avios to make the flight less expensive. Easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these BA flights. With their diminishing attitude to customer welfare, I will not use BA on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by Easyjet is, in my experience, far superior.",7.0,10.0,"""most uncomfortable plane""",2018-12-29,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Tenerife,2018-12,no,Gatwick , Tenerife
B Stauffer,"✅Trip Verified|  Johannesburg to London. I had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck. The only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night. BA has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years, and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them. The business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat, the difference is that it goes to a full bed. There is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table. As it was a late flight (10pm), the crew decided not to offer pre-dinner drinks. I ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep. Big mistake: you only get the appetiser (tiny) and the desert (even smaller). I was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew. The trays are removed when everyone else finishes, so much for getting more sleep. The crew never came back until breakfast.

I absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice. I made a complaint to the crew that my seat (30B) has sunk and I felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours. Crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it, which didn't help either. The tv screen on 30B was also not working and I didn't watch anything during the whole duration of the flight. I would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time.

Clive Drake,"✅Trip Verified|  Gatwick to Barbados. We flew out of Gatwick on the 6th December and back on the 17th Dec. It started well in the newish 1st Class lounge at the South terminal. However, the walk to the gate is miles. It has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be honest. The North terminal, where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight, the decor and layout is much, much better. I'd guess BA got offered a cheaper deal to move to the S.T. My first impression was how badly the ""new"" 1st Class is holding up. There are scuff marks everywhere. Surface scratches. Bobbles of wear on the seat fabric. It's probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10. In the WC there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains. Needs a paint job at least. The motley flowers (That BA removed some years ago to save costs, but re-instated) are there. They looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard. Much has been said about the seat being ""an up market business class"" - and this is true. It is not a true 1st Class in the sense of what Emirates and Singapore Airlines offer. (I have flown both in 1st). The food is also business class quality. More casual dining rather than fine dining. Taking one meal; it starts with an Amuse Bouche. One motley round mozzarella bit of cheese. One tomato. One bit of green stuff. One straggly piece of prosciutto ham. Total cost about 30p. Outstanding! I then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan. Totally, utterly boring. My wife had the soup which she said was nice. I then had jerk Chicken dish. It was just about okay. The glassware and chinaware was okay. The cutlery was poor quality, the stuff you'd expect in Pizza Express, except the stuff in Pizza Express is better. I accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so, but there is so much BA could do to improve the ""cheap"" look of their premium product. Quality of presentation, food, champagne, even the menu covers. They trumpet the ""superb"" Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle champagne, which retails at £120 a bottle. Its nice, but we all know this is inferior to what most Airline 1st Class offer in Krug. £20 a bottle more! The alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying-yang Club Business Class. The world's most hated Business Class in the sky. I'm a businessman and i know I could run this airline better, from a quality perspective. From a price perspective, if you bundle a 1st Flight as part of a BA holiday, it sort of works out okay-ish.

J Leeson,"✅Trip Verified|  Sydney to London via Singapore. I'm hugely disappointed with the Business class trip. The seating arrangements leave little to be desired, i.e. if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you (refer to seat guru for more understanding). Service is slow and once you have your food, good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes. If you're next to the window, you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat. The drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive. If you do get a drink, be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray, I had two drinks slip off the Teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat. Dont get me started with the in-flight entertainment or the lack of it. After I watched two movies (on a 24 hour flight) I was scratching to find anything else decent to watch. The ""new releases"" is a contradiction in terms. There is very little priority giving to Business class when boarding the plane, sure you re called first but because of the plane’s configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy.

It was all pretty slick, although the guy at check-in wasn't exactly Mr Convivial. The Concorde Room was impressive, too - particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design, overlooking the main concourse. Boarding involved lining up according to group. This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane.

The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly. The wines on offer were a good selection, including the fabulous LPGS, and we enjoyed some wine tasting. Sleep quality was considerably better than Club World, although the cabin temperature was a little high.

S Kane,"✅Trip Verified|  Vancouver to London Heathrow. I chose to fly with them because I had been told they were good for families and as I was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what I needed. The booking process was not smooth and very stressful, I have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center. The 2 flights were great though, the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure I was doing ok. The crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok I was first given a cot for my baby. I originally wanted a one of the Britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot, nope! He was too big and could not lie straight so I asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes.

B Worley,"✅Trip Verified|  Basel to San Fransisco via Heathrow. I'm convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years. I booked World Traveller Plus or Premium Economy which costs appr. twice as much as economy. The flight to SFO was ok seat wise as the plane was an A380 and I has reserved an aisle seat. The food was disgusting for me, during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza. The choice of food leaves a lot to be desired. There were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed. We were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane (longer due to a delay leaving the UK). The flight back to the UK was worse since it was a Boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats. You couldn't even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and I'm not big. The recliner didn't work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat. I feel sorry for larger people. The food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks. The staff seem challenged with certain situations.

Miguel Galeno,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Philadelphia. I upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because I  wanted to experience BA’s business class in the Boeing 787, but I was disappointed. While the aircraft was new, the staff really could have cared less about the business guests. 2-3-2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail. BA lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite, service wise was lacking. Pre-flight they offer you a beverage, I asked for rose champagne and I was told “I guess I have to go find a bottle and open one”. In my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours, not on this almost 8 hour flight. I was served my main meal almost 2.5 hours after takeoff. You get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing. You also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 1.5 hours before landing. If you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley. Yes they have the menu, linen, silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you. Because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable. There was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and that’s it. I have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no Wi-Fi on this flight. You get a pillow, duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit. BA has the new planes, and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service. I will not pay to upgrade to business on BA and will avoid flying with them if I have another option.

E Gardner,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Los Angeles. Booked this trip eight months previously and as I lost my status on BA a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats. The flight I chose was a Boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin. Never expecting anything to go according to plan with BA and our flight was cancelled a few days before. We were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an A380 to a twenty one year old Jumbo. We were then seated right at the back of Club World to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium. We were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip, he then disappeared never to be seen again. Food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight. The steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off. After a few hours I went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared, stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses. Reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink. The second meal was served about seven hours after lunch, steak sandwich, at least that one was edible. The seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered, getting out was a task in itself. I bought WiFi for the whole trip, it ran for about 50% of the flight, yet their customer (non existent) services refuse to refund the payment even though I sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service, but they are happy to note the problems. We have avoided BA now for some time, except where there is no other option as on Club Europe. But with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile.

David Ellis,"✅Trip Verified|  Brindisi to London. Flying from any airport that includes Ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign. Brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for Club Europe passengers. There was also no priority check-in, or, indeed, priority anything. Boarding was a fiasco, with two lines directed into pens, pending the mad dash to the plane, which then entailed using a rather weird, tiered set of steps that was just another queue. Service in Club Europe commenced efficiently, but the cabin crew were of the breezy, cheery type who'd have been better suited to Ryanair. The brief drinks service over, it was on to the the much-vaunted, new look Club Europe meal service. Sadly, this proved to be just another cost-cutting, exercise, with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once, and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots. And, of course, the seats haven't changed, although, interestingly, BA seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the Club Europe section, which means that the service is little different to the old economy. Still, we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes.

H Larson,"✅Trip Verified|  Rome to Newark via London. The first sector was on a A319. Flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time. Boarding at FCO was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2. Flight attendants friendly and welcoming. Seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. No entertainment either. Was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the M&S menu. Connection at T5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon. Boarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painless. I was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped. Happy to say, the seat comfort was pretty good, legroom was manageable. I was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirty. There was grime around the USB port (which didn't work), tv screen and along the floor by the wall. The cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well. I found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in response. The selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen before. The real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their service. They were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick. The main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing.

D Kemble,"Not Verified|  London Heathrow to Dubai. This was the first time I had flown in first class  on BA. I had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed. BA's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isn't the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates. We were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the BA fleet. The cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious. The sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy. It is nice they offer a male and female kit, my wife was delighted with the contents. The Champagne that BA offer in first is superb. I enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne I have tasted. Choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the Johnnie Walker Blue Label if you are a whiskey drinker. Food was very tasty and well presented. I had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then Lamb Machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille. We were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing. I cant really fault any of it. It was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too. IFE was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing,. I believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787. I do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice. The thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew. From the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous. Attentive with out being over-bearing. Witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need. They were superb. Wifi was available but the page to connect didn't load up when i tried it. I dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer. This was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first.

H Fanzen,"✅Trip Verified|  Washington to Frankfurt via London. Check-In at Dulles Airport was smooth. I asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did, even though at the online check-in there was none available. Boeing 747-400 was 27 years old, the IFE was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad. The seats were ok, pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good. My seat was 27A and I had the whole row for myself. Unfortunately a crew member shortly before take-off told me that another passenger had issues with his IFE and they would replace him on 27C. Shortly after take-off the service began. There were 2 food options available. Chicken and vegatarian lasagne, I went for the Lasagne which was ok, nothing special. It came with a salad, a bread bun and a black forest cake. All in all an ok meal, nothing to complain about. The crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying. After dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep. I tried to watch some movies (the selection was ok) which was hard on this miniature IFE. In the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle. Connecting in Heathrow is pretty easy (in T5) there are signs everywhere! Security went fast. There is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free WIFI. We boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds. BA started to do a buy-on-board service which I hate.

S Andrews,"✅Trip Verified| London to Athens. Since I started using BA in 2011, I can only say that the quality becomes worse. The leg room in Business Class in A320 is the same like in economy. The only thing that you get is an empty middle seat. The meal choices are poor: I had to choose between curry and fish pie. Also, they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5-10 mins (once we ate the starter), they took the starter plate and they gave us the main. The on board service, is less 'attentive' than some years ago (probably cabin crew are over-utilised and want to get some rest which is understandable). Also, due to the plane being late, the cabin was not cleaned properly. At some point we need to think why would someone choose BA over low cost airlines. Tickets are priced in a similar way, there is no food on board for the economy (while for business the portion and variety are a joke), leg space is small, there are always delays to depart from Heathrow (not BAs fault, but at the end of the day I experience delays).

Matthew Haycock,"✅Trip Verified|  London Heathrow to Singapore. Had a great experience in the Concorde Room, and Galleries First lounges in Heathrow T5. I was warmly greeted by a member of the crew, who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around, all because I expressed a slight interest, and for that I am thankful. The flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit. The seat was very well presented, there was a small amenity kit, as well as a pair of pyjamas. The seat was clean with pillows, as well as ample storage space. You get a closet to hang clothes, a little compartment next to the seat, as well as the overhead bin, so I never ran out of room. The pre-departure beverage was a choice of water, orange juice, or champagne and hot towels were handed out. The flight left slightly behind schedule, but at Heathrow, this is something you expect. Very soon after take-off, the crew began serving dinner. I had already booked my meal in advance, but the choice of starters, mains and deserts, as well as the beverage menu, was very good. The meal I had was exceptionally tasty and I would have it again! Once dinner service had finished, the crew turned down the bed for me, whilst I went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided. The bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall, I did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out. There were plenty of blankets and pillows available and I slept very well. When I awoke, I was offered coffee and a short while later, breakfast. The breakfast choices were continental, or cooked. I opted for the cooked option and I was not disappointed, as it was very tasty, and there was a lot of it. The inflight entertainment was good, and there was a large range of films, TV programmes/series, audio books, and kids programmes to choose from. The system was responsive and was good quality, although I did not watch any films, so I cannot speak of the sound quality. The crew served with a smile and even when I asked for a Latte, which the machine didn’t do, the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice.

When asked, the attendant brought an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray LSML. Obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm, dry and I was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food. Not the same as my husbands meal, so I have to take the airlines word LSML that it was low sodium. Attendants serving coffee missed us and when I pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up. One pass through the cabin for drinks. After that, you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink. Sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous. Hummus, limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least. I expected edible food and better, more friendly service with this airline. Our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal.

Mike Palmer,"✅Trip Verified|  Toronto to LHR and LGW to Toronto return in WT+. Finally, BA has moved back into it’s own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture. However, Premium Plaza still staff and operate the lounge. Food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor. Slick boarding and a full PE cabin on a 777. Water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights TO London. (apparently 3 are loaded in London for the O/W leg but none for the return.) Friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service. Fast bar service followed by Veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul. salty, dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables. The salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice. Pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross. Got a couple of hours sleep. However the IFE froze after take off due to the PA system remaining locked on and preventing the IFE from working. A reset halfway through the flight worked, though two loud renditions of Delibe’s “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up. The standard T&Cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing. I continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is. (BA should be embarrassed that it’s even offered) After leaving Toronto 5 mins late, we arrived 5 early at the gate at Heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags. For the return leg, I took the seasonal LGW to Toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper. An upgrade to Club World was a pleasant surprise. Fast check in at LGW but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane. Gatwick Airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with BA Fast track customers. Excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food, and champagne available as a help yourself. Efficient boarding and a great reception from the Gatwick cabin crew. A fast offering of champagne (with a top up) before take off though the old safety video was still showing. The Gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from Heathrow – more experienced, faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service. Fast bar service once airborne, followed by the old Biz food service. Overcooked steak (again) alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option. Plenty of wine and drinks along with T&C. After a pleasant 3 hour nap, I woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues. At the gate early and fast bags too. This club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service. So new toiletries and bedding but the old menu. I hope Gatwick catches up so BA don’t (unintentionally) promote two levels of Biz service with LGW being the poor relative. On the O/W leg, premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp. The food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast, and it really wouldn’t take much to add better food, bedding and an enhanced drink service as BA really lag behind Air Canada on this route with premium economy. I do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat.

Did not want to pay the usual BA extortionate seat pre-reservation fees but still got seats together. After the real scrum at the departure gate - no apparent order, struggle to get through to Priority Lane, announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable, if narrow, seats. Of course the usual BA Club Class ""scramble over the legs"" to get to the aisle and 8 abreast - not really a premium product in today's competitive Business Class World.

Very extensive choice for breakfast - continental and cooked if you wanted it. Really very good FA's - made you feel welcome. Landed on time but baggage, for some reason, took about 3/4 hour to get to the belt.

L Shearen,"✅Trip Verified| This was a night flight New York JFK to London, so it was difficult to assess the service onboard, although what I experienced was certainly not bad. I think this was a very quiet flight, judging from the number of people around the gate, and there were only another 4-5 pax in First. But it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the Concorde Room and First cabin. The former felt very exclusive but, as commented elsewhere, to the point of being fussy. It's irritating that they don't have any showers in the Concorde Room; I wasn't amused to check in at the Galleries (business) Lounge, be brusquely sent on to Concorde, only to have to return to Galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former (it was 7pm, early August in NYC - of course I needed a shower!). Departures from NY were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather, and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway. But we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin wasn't secured until just before takeoff, and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple - and very welcome - top-ups of champagne, seved by various members of the crew. Likewise, all the perks of first class were there; I was addressed by name, the crew introduced themselves individually, dinner and drinks orders were taken, etc. All very courteous and professional. After such a long delay, I decided to have some more dinner as I was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine, and was served promptly, so there was still plenty of time for sleep. But the soup was cold, and the main wouldn't have been out of place in business class. Moreover, it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the BA arrivals lounge at LHR would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had I known this, I would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane. A very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience (picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in T5 arrivals toilets...perhaps you saw me?). The cabin layout and bed: well, it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online. But it's certainly nothing special for First Class. Overall, a very acceptable flight, but I felt that the overly-fussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight Atlantic crossing (where can I have a shower in the morning? Where will I be having breakfast?).

We checked in on time, only to be advised that there was no lounge available for Club Europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay!

Paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with BA, that no lounge access was available.

New York to Nairobi via London. Flight Attendants were wonderful, friendly, cheery and helpful. But the business Class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger, even if you are seated next to a companion. There is no easily accessible storage space by the seat; even for a bottle of water. The IFE on the LHR-NBO leg reminds me of the game ""pong"" in its resolution and food is mediocre, at best. BA charges to select Business Class seats.

E Tellon,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Santiago de Chile. I was flying premium economy with BA and surprised that I got a row (2 seats on the left side) for my own. The seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat, I would have had enough space to feel very comfortable. However, Lufthansa on the A380 (also Y+) gives a bit more personal space (at least it seems to me). The seat recline was good as well as the ife system (big screen, wide choice of programs of which I chose to listen to some BBC concerts). The crew didn't impress me but was very friendly and helpful. The food was extraordinarily good (the chicken I had was very delicious) with sufficient food (cheese, salad, dessert). The frittata on breakfast wasn't good, however. I didn't like that they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival (a bit early).  I had a good experience with BA and would definitely fly again as all the things (seat, ground, service, staff) were like expected (the dinner was way above average).

Richard Hodges,"✅Trip Verified|  Flew a now ageing B777 flight BA 0053 to Seattle. Pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal. OK choice of wine / beer with meal and greeted with glass of Prosecco when boarded. Comfortable seat BUT it's the old bug bear - 8 across with ""over the legs"" access to the aisle. Fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access. And we could look at each other and not at a total stranger. I know BA are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in Club Class but this can't come soon enough - and 8 abreast is not exactly a Premium Product in the present circumstances, is it? Absolutely terrible In Flight Entertainment system - although it was On Demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system: blurry, old screens, awful audio (take your own noise reducing headphones) and a pretty dreadful choice of movies.... FA's great welcoming and gave good service. But the main drawback with BA is their insistence that, having paid for a premium service, we then have to pay handsomely again to pre-reserve our seats (up to £105 per seat per journey!).  Not what I expect from a flag carrier airline. We refuse to pay this extortionate sum - our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far. So, although we had quite a pleasant flight to Seattle with BA in Club, if Virgin Atlantic fly the same route we will choose their Upper Class over Clubworld - we can still reserve our seats for free with them.",8.0,10.0,"""pay again to pre-reserve seats""",2018-07-30,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Seattle Tacoma,2018-07,no,London Heathrow , Seattle Tacoma

The flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am, which was oddly specific, but as we got closer to that time, that just got more and more delayed. Until we finally got our gate info at around 7:45. For which boarding had already started. Boarding was pretty much seamless. The cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice. The legroom was alright, perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight. Good recline aswell. I don’t understand why British Airways opted for buy on board, their free food offering before was perfectly fine. Although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive. And there was no real hot food options, just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot. Flights were on time. Flights cost around £320 return per person, which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price.

G Meales,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Amsterdam. BA's service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight's experience really takes the biscuit. I should now be in Amsterdam - however, I am still writing this from London despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere. We boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. Shortly after, we were told that the routes north of LHR were shut, and no planes were taking off. About an hour into the ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. One more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. After 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later. We did then leave the gate, and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. We were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that AMS would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived, so our flight wad cancelled. We taxied back to the gate, where we waited a further 10-15 minutes for ground staff to become available. I must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very good. The crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and watered. This is the full extent of my praise though. Little was I to know that the real disaster was still to come. BA's ground handling was attrocious. We were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. However, BA had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthy. Vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because ""all the rooms were full"". I have never heard anything like it. This is beyond unbelievable. No assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situation. Further, the promised ""rebooking"" staff had all gone home - I was told to consult the BA app the following morning. BA's app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days total. The feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so I can replan my trip for another weekend, is broken. I guess I'll be trying out their call centre in the morning. This is all simply appalling. We all understand that adverse weather happens. But to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. Moreover, BA surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. Why they could not have prioritised the AMS flight over flights to 24-hour airports I do not know. And as for the ground handling, I have never had an experience this bad. BA staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to Heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the ""we don't work for BA excuse"". I've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn't have handled it better. By contrast, I don't see how BA could have handled this worse.

You get the basics and good luck if you want to grab their attention. They walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact. No bags at the other end on arrival which I guess you have to live with, however the way they deal with it is appalling. Couldn't care less I feel. 3hr delay on return flights.

Food and wine on-board was quite good and overall service excellent, including recognising my One World Status. BA has the best in-flight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in-flight programs.

C Down,"✅Trip Verified|  Faro to Gatwick. Club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at Faro. BA now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here, which sadly is absolutely awful! It feels like an average office canteen, with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there. It’s really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc. Considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport, it’s a pathetic offering. Food was minimal and basic, drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available. Whilst BA do provide priority boarding, they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this. Once on board, I have similar comments to my outbound flight.. in my opinion they should provide a better welcome, a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off. Overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight, although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier.. at one point I dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone else’s seat. I was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all, instead just looking mildly annoyed that I was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it.

The lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available.. including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam. As always the drinks offering in BA lounges was great. The new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and BA staff are finally enforcing the priority system.. long may it continue! On board was the usual club Europe offering.. which while not exactly luxury is standard for Europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine. BA don’t ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete, there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind.. it’s a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier. I would also like to see menus handed out before take off, which could be done at the same time as a welcome.

As a resident of the Netherlands I hear Dutch people saying exactly the same about KLM, their national airline, and french friends say the same about Air France. The onboard service was efficient and friendly, if a little lacking in charm. The food was more than adequate. The in-flight entertainment was adequate too. I'm not sure if the extra one pays for Economy Plus is really worth it in terms of better food, but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters, then it is worth it. When we landed at Heathrow, a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off.

The staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there. The person next to me and I asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left - too little had apparently been loaded. There was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice. We asked for the fish. After some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal. I had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice - no apology. Eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable. We were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice 40 minutes before landing. We were not given anything. The service was really poor - and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines.

Flight left close to on time. Service was quick as we were first served at the back. We were given pretzels and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later, which was vegetarian pasta for me. Adequate amount of food served and was tasty. Ice cream and juice/water was served halfway through the flight. We then received a snack before landing which was a sandwich and a toblerone. It was ok. Return flight from Vegas was on a old 747. Horrible old seats with no padding and very dirty. Service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff. Less drinks served, again food was ok chicken curry this time. Small snack of a egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast. IFE was horrendous on the old 747 tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice.

I found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes, in its 3-3-3 seating configuration, despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard, the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft I have flown on other transatlantic routes, 777, 767, A340 and 747.

Having paid business class fares, we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional €476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors. Had we not selected seats, we could have found ourselves not just separated, but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the A380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight. We therefore had no choice. What sort of customer retention policy is this? No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don't seem to care. It is a rip-off. The forward/rear facing business class seat plan on BA planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. BA should take a look at the Emirates A380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout. This was our first business class experience with BA.

BA’s Galleries lounge at CPT is adequate but let down by a poor food selection (including packaged cheese and biscuits, with flimsy wooden knives) and limited wine choices. Champagne was conspicuously lacking. Toilet paper wasn’t being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors. There were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. Boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. Seats 62J/K on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. Take off was on schedule. FAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in Club World. The 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. The White Company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts. There's little one can do to remedy a hard seat. Landing was ahead of schedule.

Mike Palmer,"✅Trip Verified| I took the new option of the new Toronto to London Gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route. Cheaper than the Heathrow service, it was an interesting experiment in whether I could fall back in love with Gatwick. Excellent check in at Pearson as usual, but spoiled by the third party lounge. Goodness knows what BA were thinking, given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options. The Premium Plaza lounge is cheap and nasty. On time boarding on a near empty flight (too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up). The cabin was a third full. Juice and water offered. No Prosecco in Premium Economy though the crew member couldn't explain why it's not offered to London, but why Champagne in Biz is manageable. On time departure, and a fast drinks service. This is my first experience of Gatwick crew. Fast, sociable, less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving Heathrow. (and all over 25!) The meal was vile - overcooked, salty and dry. As the plane was empty, I went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats. Awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing. IFE on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at Christmas! An early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight. Returning, I liked the biz / first class check in area at LGW - fast and friendly. The lounge at Gatwick was streets ahead of Heathrow. Self serve Champagne and loads of seats. Kept very clean and plenty of food. An upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight. Efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service. A really fast bar service only 20 mins in, with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from Heathrow. The only thing that spoilt it was off duty BA staff in Biz, chatting (and distracting) the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying. An early arrival into Toronto finished a near perfect flight, The Gatwick 777s are old - very old with no power in Premium Economy.

I was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however I was very pleasantly surprised. Shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read. Not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty. I had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate. We were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne. The crew were very attentive and helpful. They had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past. The seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine. This flight was an upgrade using Avios and I would happily do it again.

Leslie Mardell,"✅Trip Verified|  Our original flight was cancelled as my wife and I were just disembarking from a cruise ship. We were then advised shortly after by SMS that we had been automatically re-booked on a flight the next day, to London Heathrow. This was not a lot of good when our car was parked at Gatwick. I managed to get through to BA and was given a new booking to Gatwick also the following day. We were offered no other assistance by the airline. The following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late. Having eventually boarded the aircraft, we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at Barcelona airport. Shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours, so we would be given water. This was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice, so no water was served. The real horror of this flight, however, was British Airways new food service, whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/Avios. This simply does not work. After one hour in the air, the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin. Eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley. About 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps (potato chips). He returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can, which we duly shared between us. Having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours, this was the only refreshment we could obtain.

While in Bucharest I sustained a fall and although I wasn't seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage. At the Bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance, which I accepted - and was promptly wheeled through security, passport control and the (very long) corridors to the gate, then put aboard the plane. On arrival in London I was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of T5 and onto the plane, this time with the pleasant surprise of another Club World upgrade (this time for free). Once on the plane back to Washington the cabin crew couldn't do enough for me, checking how I was doing, going through meal choices (the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items I really can't eat but ultimately I still ate well), getting me drinks, and more. They were as professional and proactive a crew as I've ever experienced in 40 years of long-haul travel. Finally, once arrived at Dulles more assistance was waiting, right up to getting my cab. What could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined - through the years I've had mostly excellent experiences with BA cabin crews and that's a big reason why I've stayed with BA all these years and will continue to do so.

But having secured a couple of return flights to Cape Town with Avios, our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking. Unfortunately, Terminal 3 isn't the best starting point and Galleries First lacks glamour - or decent champagnes. The food on offer is adequate, although hardly first class. Hoping for better on board, we didn't use the sit down menu. Boarding was on time and according to BA's new group allocation. Our seats - 2K and 3K - were a first for us, as we've previously gone for pairs in the centre. But seats A and K are definitely superior, with more storage space and better privacy. However, there's no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane, particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley. The IFE is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade. But at least it didn't require rebooting on our flight. Cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag. The FA looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job. Food was better than usual, although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast.

J Keapher,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Hamburg. Typically if I fly BA it is SFO or LAX to LHR. This time I flew them from Miami via Tampa thru LHR to Hamburg. Using their Avios points I secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because BA charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at $500 per direction. Their Miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to American as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the American premium class (not) lounge. All the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what I call a premium lounge. The BA gate in the dreadful E terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs. People jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections. Boarding was like a cattle call. BA flies one of its oldest B747 into Miami and it showed even in first. The seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet. The service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of California. The flight was late leaving and late arriving, and this Miami flight does not dock in terminal 5. Rather terminal 3 and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what I did for my connection to Hamburg. In the end I decided I was done with BA because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom.

Pre-booked seats at the same time. I was rather surprised when I got an email two weeks out saying “about your flight to Madrid on the 26th May” when I was flying direct Heathrow to Menorca. Airline assured me everything was fine. Further concern when self-service check-in opened 24 hours out, wife and daughters checked in fine, me and my son were referred to airport check-in (despite all being on the same booking). An urgent call to BA I was told 1) I was probably being moved to a bassinet position. When I pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2) infants can’t check in online which I now understand is also incorrect. My concern was well placed. At BA T5 bag drop, check in agent looked flustered, a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes. Only after I checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre-booked seats were gone, my son and I had no seats at all and were standby, and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin (16 rows apart). ‘Prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know!’ After kicking up a huge fuss (I believe they can’t legally sit children below a certain age away from parents?) the check-in manager offered me no explanation other than full flights, but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight. Fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the check-in supervisor (who cant have been more than 22) in tears. When I eventually got seen I was finally given a seat number for me and my son, again many rows apart from the rest of my family. As this was my sons first ever flight, I was absolutely livid that we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other. Added to that, my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding, kids needing toilet etc. I put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness. We boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son I get to my assigned seat and someone is in it. Asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat. Cue BA staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes. Such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff, I even heard one of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight’! Fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that we’re going to have to get off here and my children in tears. Much checking of iPads and a BA staff member is then found (there were quite a few on the flight apparently) and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight (what seat?).

Neil Jeram,"✅Trip Verified| Singapore to London. This was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380. Now this aircraft, in Qantas colours, is one I am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with QF. As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. The same comments for that review apply here. The IFE is a work of mystery in terms of content. On Qantas, American, Cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. Those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (Godfather, Gladiator, Brave-heart, Roman Holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. Some smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. IFE is one thing on long haul. The other is food and beverage. The food quality was just substandard and something I read about constantly. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. At the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. You would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. BA need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. The A380 is a flagship aircraft and on Qantas it is treated as such. I am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. Put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. The BA crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. One guy looked like Steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. Flying on an A380 should be an experience and I enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. BA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. That is sad given the stature of BA. I came back on BA31 from London to Hong Kong and the same comments apply. Hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.",4.0,10.0,"""IFE is a work of mystery""",2018-05-26,A380,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to London,2018-05,no,Singapore , London
Neil Jeram,"✅Trip Verified| Sydney to London via Singapore. It has been a very long time since I was on a long haul with BA of more than 9 hours. Last year had a relative sprint from London to JFK and before that in 2002. The years have not been kind to BA. Probably a mixture of the decline of BA and the emergence of other airlines. Nearly all my long haul is with Qantas on its A380, occasionally Emirates on its version and then once in a while with Cathay Pacific and American Airlines. The problem is not the hard product. A B777 or the A380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame. The B777 from Sydney to Singapore was fine. Nosier than the A380 but that is well known. Very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call Sydney home. It is the soft product that is lacking. Check in was fine and despite being in Economy had an express pass through security (being a Gold FF with Qantas). Boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into Singapore. Now its just a lack of polish with the soft product. No menu given showing what was to be served (as with Cathay, Emirates and Qantas). The cutlery was really cheap and I mean cheap. KFC offers a better grade of plastic. I know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at BA needs to check out the plastic used on Cathay and Qantas). The food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty. Qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert. It's just the quality that is lacking. Drinks? I have a tradition, something silly, about starting a journey off with a Jack Daniels and Coke. This is available on Qantas but no sir, we don't serve that. A note about the FA's: they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver. Final word about this leg is the iFE. A touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad. Award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years. One or two interesting things and some new releases. Come on BA, for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics. As for music: well I'm 53 but still like the Pearl Jams etc of the world. We are not all into Brit Pop and edgy music presenters. If BA is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills, the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline. It is a mix of BA going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that BA set many years ago.",4.0,10.0,"""years have not been kind""",2018-05-25,Boeing 777-200,Business,Economy Class,Sydney to London via Singapore,2018-05,no,Sydney , London via Singapore

I remember them as not a ""top of the line"" airline, but better than average. This time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped (hot towels as you neared your destination), and they have become almost a low fare airline. You pay for reserving seats, on shorter flights you pay for food, etc. The seating on the Boeing 787 seemed very cramped. It is said to be 31"" but seemed like less. On the return flight on May 3rd, two of the lavatories went out of service. The A320 from London to Prague seemed to have more seat room, but the seats were very hard. They may be the new ""slimline"" seats, I'm not sure, but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight. Also, on the Washington  to LHR flight we had printed out boarding passes at home. The agent at Washington printed out additional ones and said we should use them, but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and none for my wife. It was lucky we still had the one we printed out at home. I won't say that I will not fly them again, but I will definitely compare prices in the future.

On the evening before departure I received an email from BA the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldn't be a delay. In the end the aircraft left Tokyo Haneda with a 90 minutes delay. Baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with Japanese politeness. If you have the choice to fly from NRT or HND I would definitely choose HND because it's much more conveniently located to downtown Tokyo. The aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft, adding more time to the delay we already had. I didn't like the seats on the 777. I found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient, especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you. On the window and aisle seats, there's also the IFE box so there's no place for both feet. The meal was a joke and there was no choise. Inflight entertainment is not up to date, small screens with low brightness. The crew was not very friendly. When I went to the galley for a drink I was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs. The second meal service was rushed. We've got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to LHR.  Luckily I've made it to my connecting flight to Amsterdam because I had a short connection. The A320 flight to Amsterdam departed ahead of schedule.

A Palomo,✅Trip Verified| Check-in at Vienna Airport was painless. BA uses Air Lounge at Vienna and was adequate with enough seating and food was okay. Boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to Club Europe passengers. The flight wasn’t full therefore service was quite prompt. I found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk to. The food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwiches. One passenger wasn’t very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was. Business class was quite average to be honest.

On this flight, after deciding not to spend on an upgrade, I was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room - didn't feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once. Although I slept a lot of the way, the cabin crew were very helpful - even asking the captain to find the direction of Mecca so I could pray (in my seat). Was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee - i had to ask for both, but was given without any fuss. A380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent, although I noticed a funny (not that loud) motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey.

They also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage area. The food service was also disappointing, the duck breast as my main course was very tough.

Totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots.  The cabin crew on both sectors were polite, friendly and professional. Their service was excellent. I wasn’t feeling well on the out bound flight and I didn’t eat anything, so I can’t comment on the food. On the return flight, in Club World, the food was very good, no complaints there. The seats were comfortable although the Club World cabin felt cramped. I was in 53K which is a window rear facing bulk head seat. As it was a daytime flight, the noise coming from the galley didn’t bother me, but I think it would be an issue on night flights. I hope BA change their business class seating for something like AA business class on their 777-300s. BA business class is really dated, and I said it felt cramped. My BIG issue, and this isn’t entirely BA’s fault was the over zealous security screening at Heathrow. I was pulled aside for screening 3 times.

B Seares,"✅Trip Verified| Premium economy worse than most airlines economy. Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge.

C Norton,"✅Trip Verified| I have been flying with BA for the last 32 years between Sao Paulo and London on and off but mostly BA. I have travelled in all classes except First. BA used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares. Not value for money. The food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink, even in Business (I flew out Club and returned Economy plus). Staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude, no changes there. Boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number. Service is not exclusive anymore. Seats on the 777-300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on CLub. Their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety (in case of food allergies/intolerances) really bad and of poor quality. It is a shame Singapore Airlines doesn't fly to Brazil from the UK as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class. BA has become mean, greedy and indifferent to their customers and I feel it is time for the CEO to go as he is ruining the image of the airline. The changes on baggage weight has become silly also. I was allowed two luggages of 23kg. Any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as I haven't go above the allowance I am entitled. Instead I had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14. In my opinion unnecessary as I had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg! So I will in future re-think my trips to Brazil. Even if I have to make my journey longer as I am after good service, value for money and a differentiated experience.

B Palmer,"✅Trip Verified| Flew British Airways from Budapest to London Heathrow. Quite possibly the worst flight I have ever had (and I travel often). Generally when we travel, we try to pack our hand baggage light, as we check our heavier bags and it's more convenient for other passengers too. My partner and I had 2 briefcase-sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker. As more passengers boarded, most with as-large-as-possible carryons, the overhead lockers filled up. The flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads, takes out our bags, hands them to us and says ""I'm sorry but the space is needed for large bags"", telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us. Reducing our leg room to zero. How is this at all fair? I questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry-ons, and was given the response that I would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded. I have no idea who at BA thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean ""thank you for bringing smaller carry-ons than everyone else, as a measure of our appreciation, we'll take away your leg room"". The general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention. Young adults barely out of high school, and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services Starbucks, such was their experience at providing pleasant service. What a sad state of affairs. I will never ever travel British Airways willingly again, long haul or short haul. I would rather take a civilised one-stop journey with Lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct British Airways flight.",1.0,10.0,"""the worst flight I have ever had""",2018-04-10,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to London Heathrow,2018-03,no,Budapest , London Heathrow

As this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might get some sleep and I now wish we'd saved the extra that it cost, a complete waste of money. The cabin is very dated, and cramped, it wasn't clean (half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor) and the service and food were average at best. Why in this day and age do BA persist with having seats with no direct aisle access? Not that I could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway, the seat was adequate and no more, the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky, needing very firm contact to get any response. On top of this there was no USB point to charge my phone! I expected better cabin service than we got, not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it - I certainly don't expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier.

Security staff insisted on using a whole-body scanner for everyone and were overly officious. Surprisingly, there was no business class lounge, although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal. Boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance. Club World was in two smaller cabins, with the usual, outdated eight seats abreast. Take-off was on time. The wrong menus had been loaded, so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy. Drinks and food service served efficiently. Food adequate and not overcooked, but below the standard of Turkish Airlines. Seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping, with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat.

This also means that if there are 3 or 4 flights, and a group of two (as in my case) the difference would be substantial, up to approx 1000$. Lucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasn't full. On board service was decent. Professional, courteous and friendly attendants.

F Hamzil,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Muscat first class. First time trying out first class on BA. Check-in was fairly quick and efficient, didn't have much luggage, but the first wing did not feel very exclusive. I had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as I got printed boarding pass. Concorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some places. Had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. Checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment I booked for the Spa. Onboard was informed there was a problem with the Seat I had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. Upon entering the first class cabin, I had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. I asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that I will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. I did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. Seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. The TV screen seemed quite large and high quality. Unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the TV. Soon after take off, I was informed I could eat when I like. Arabic starter was great. Had pre-selected main meal online. Meal was of good quality and cooked well. Had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese I've had in some Business class). Surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, I imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. After finishing the one film I decided to watch, I decided to try get some sleep. Crew made the bedding while I tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. Bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. I missed breakfast, as I was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. Overall, I was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. The crew were very friendly and professional. Given this was first class, have to admit there was no wow factor, either with the soft product or ground experience.

Thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. We were told in economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an emergency tap water could be provided - so much for a full-service airline! Any newspapers also gone from business class. On LHR-GOT route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. Lounges OK - preferred MAN to LHR (which is busy and looking worn already). The down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. The FAs were a saving grace, though rest assured, they are not happy.

O Thompson,"✅Trip Verified| A fairly average flight to Cape Town and return. The old 777s they use out of Gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable. The TV screen is very small and fuzzy (and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working) but the selection of entertainment is OK. The food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with British Airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys.

Who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast? Bizarre and ridiculous. Looking around the cabin very few were eaten.

The BA premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering. The promised fine China dining experience only relates to main course. All other food and drink was served in plastic. The entire meal came on a cluttered tray, dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever. The chick pea starter was icy cold, the main course lamb over cooked, tasteless and inedible. Dessert and cheese portions were minuscule. Entertainment screen was marbled and very small.

Jonathan Grimshaw,"✅Trip Verified|  Gatwick to Tobago. Many years since I've flown in BA club class. Interested to see if all the bad reviews are justified. Outbound flight to Tobago on 1 January was delayed 2 hours because cleaners hadn't turned up. Floor around seat not vacuumed properly. Looked for flight attendant to see if my jacket could be hung up. FA took jacket from me and stuffed it into overhead locker. Invited over PA system to read High Life magazine - not in seat pocket - had to ask. Pre-flight drinks served ok. When asked for meal choice, options didn't correspond with what was on menu. Asked FA if I had wrong menu. FA insisted it was right menu. Looked again and FA said it was wrong menu and brought correct one. Meal ok: fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tasty. Seat was comfortable, if snug. Ying/yang seat layout makes it hard for FAs to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless you're in an aisle seat. Meal tray not horizontal. Didn't bother to watch movie as screen quality poor. Flight had caught up a bit on arrival at Antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator. Arrived Tobago 5 hrs late. Return overnight flight left Tobago on time. Old school FAs on board - attentive, capable, unobtrusive. Don't think BA trains them like that any more. Meal tray came with dessert already on it I hadn't selected. When converted to bed, seat is good for length but cramped widthwise so you can't bend your legs, as I do, in sleep. Got a couple of hrs sleep lying on my back. Seems fairly common for FAs on other airlines to come through occasionally during the night asking, if you're obviously awake, if they can get you anything. Not on this flight. I guess if we want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring ""Club Kitchen"". Breakfast ok and flight arrived slightly early.

I called the local number they gave me, but the call was routed every time back to Madrid who again refused to take the claim. Finally, on about my third attempt to reason with the agents I found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim. However, I did not still see my suitcase until four days later.

I found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked. The staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight. I know BA Club Seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown with. Entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp, cannot see when lights are on in the cabin. Very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at BA.

Michael Palmer,"✅Trip Verified|  Toronto to London return – business to London and First back to Toronto all on Avios. Fast check in at Pearson with the usual friendly check in team. Fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. BA (presumably to save money) have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – Premium Plaza. Its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled high. Elevator music drove us mad, and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft - (what on earth are you thinking BA?) Fast boarding, though with fewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmented. Late with Champagne, wash bag after take off etc. With only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. The new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. We were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin, had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. All choices were available but the food is just not club standard. Poor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. BA really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to New York have to last for?? Got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. Returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new First check in, fast track and Concorde lounge. Excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. Some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. Dry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and scones. Early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after landing). These were my first mixed fleet Biz and first class service experiences. The crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smart. However, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. Long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights.

Paul Renshaw,"✅Trip Verified|  Las Vegas to Manchester via London. Fairly dire as always. BA is cutting the new Club World product as I speak, before even having rolled it out. Addicted to cuts. Perfect partner for AA. So I get on board and am told I now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg, so why did I not fly a low cost airline? There no difference whatsoever? The crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced. And what do you get for food on a transatlantic 10 hour flight to Vegas? A starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes. No oil, just some grey vinegar, it was foul I assume, nobody ate it. The main was tomato pasta or curry. The curry was so appalling I ate none of it. The chicken was like paste, the sauce dried out, and the rice overcooked. I cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing, a mini blueberry muffin, was given to my ravenous neighbour. No cheese, crackers these days, nothing. Served with cold tea. I really loved, also, being rammed on a transfer bus from T3 to LHR T5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy. The driver just kept shouting to move down the bus, it won't leave until it is full! Then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on. And to top it all of, BA now offers a free copy of the Sun instead of the Mail or Express. I have another flight in May which is non-refundable, I am desperately hoping they move my flight so I can cancel, they usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good. This is not a full service airline. It is fully no frills. The only exception is, I think, is the long haul canteen meal you get. The airline is a national embarrassment. The flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given, but the ground staff are beyond it. Fly this budget airline at your own peril, think about spending a bit more.

Because we have been given 801 USD No phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto today's flight. Furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 USD in the first place The callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested BA return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves. The tag that may have fallen off is of no concern as everyone is well aware the shell of the case has the bar code stickers on it for that exact reason so that you can track the items.",1.0,10.0,"""currently looking for the luggage""",2017-12-17,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,First Class,London to Houston,2017-12,no,London , Houston
Omar Swidan,"✅Trip Verified| Flew British Airways from Dubai to London Heathrow. Overnight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early to a very easy to navigate through T5. Unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flight. Flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment. B747 are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated. The food was OK. The biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested. No smiles or even a ""welcome on board"" whilst walking down the aisle. On arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengers. The service provided by BA has significantly declined over the past few years. Even the newer planes (B777 and B787) haven't got cabins that compete with todays market. Also, just like other budget airlines, you now have to pay to choose your seat.

However, the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food-vouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation. However, there was no information on connecting flights in LHR.

You had to pay for food in economy which is new norm of BA and they predict other airlines will follow suit. Difficult to get a glass of water. Three requests and then it materialised and that too for a young child. At check-in their automated system failed so it was done manually - thank goodness for carbon units still employed by BA. Overall BA is dramatically failing. Those who have BA miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlines. BA is no longer UK's national airline.

H Kawaldha,✅Trip Verified|  London to Toulouse. British Airways is no longer a full service airline. To compete with EasyJet and Ryan Air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with M&S food. This is over-priced and not that great. Secondly the food was never complementary- it was included in your ticket price. This was the case in this flight to Toulouse. Next time go to Pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board. I asked for a glass of water. This came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle. At least offer people water - it is a human right. The seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits. In this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll.  I was told by the cabin crew when I asked about the new service level that more may be in store for BA's comers - charging for food in economy class for long haul flights. I hope that this is not true. The only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good. Customer care and service has gone. Avoid BA if you can. Consume your BA miles and shift to other full service carriers.

While the terminal, staff, aircraft, and seats are of the same high standards as before - the free in-flight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased. It seems that BA is slowly morphing into a low-cost carrier at least as far as European destinations are concerned.

Heidy Lopez,"✅Trip Verified|  Vancouver to Edinburgh via London was the worst travel experience I have had. I was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. We actually had to beg for help. The distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. In our way from London to Edinburgh it was a nightmare. The flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. The 2 seniors had to walk all that way. It was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. On our way back from Inverness to Canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. Once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. They said that they called the buggy and that was all. We said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. We were lucky I asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in London) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. This gentleman who is not British Airways employee provided a great service. Summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance I asked and he decided to help us out. Seats were another problem. We did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12D for one senior (isle) and 18D (isle) for the other senior. When we got to the counter in Inverness Airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. Then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. So once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in Vancouver. Surprise surprise! We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggage.  They said we had to pick it up before going through customs. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. So nightmare again!! And another rush to us to get to the next fligh. According to Westhet agents they said that British airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. What can you expect from British Airways? If It doesn’t even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance.

Am pleased to confirm that the Concorde lounge has had a long overdue make-over. It looks a bit better. Had a snack and a few glasses of fizz - then made my way to terminal B. Friendly FA showed me and wife to our seats. Looked freshly cleaned. Pushed back on time. 1st Class was full. Airborne I had dinner: Mezze to start which was nice. Some chicken thingy for mains - which was horrible. Cheese and biscuits to conclude. Wines were ok. The seat (the new ""First"") - is not wearing well. Looking somewhat tired. Managed to get some sleep on the ""bed"" with the usual duvet and blankets. I am a tall guy and need the space. the Club World option is horrendous. Very pleased to confirm that Mr Alex Cruz (BAs CEO) has re-introduced flowers in the 1st WC. Readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs. If Mr Cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers 747-400s. So a full 1st cabin will generate about £40,000 of revenue. The flowers (for 2 WCs) probably cost £8.00 - so, pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the re-introduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight. The 1st product is very mediocre compared with say Emirates. Some have said its ""sort of an upmarket Business class"". I'd agree with that.

Boarding: There are now so many 'priority boarding' passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second-class citizens. (The new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further.) Since I was traveling on a 'low-price' ticket, I found myself seated right at the back of the airplane. Yes, BA appears intent on replicating England's class system!  On board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a French ATC strike. Obviously, this was not BA's fault, but no drinks, not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac. After take off, the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin. Why BA offer heated sandwiches, further slowing down their BOB service even further, when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place, is beyond me. The no-cash policy further contributes to the snail-pace progress of the trolley. The trolley (and a cup of tea) was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes. End of service. Someone at the back quipped, 'So you opted for the premium seats, too!' Yes, BA is a joke, its attitude towards passengers (its customers) shameless and embarrassing.

B Mantourieux,"✅Trip Verified|  Bangkok to London Heathrow. Despite all the negative reviews I decided to fly with BA on my recent trip to Europe, on this route BA has a daylight flight (I can't stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you can't sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted), more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service. The fare was also pretty good. In the end, I have to admit my mates were right, this was a let down all along. My issues were the following. I purchased a ticket in premium economy. The advertised seats on the BA Thailand website were reflecting the newer version, when in fact not one of the 777-200 which operates the LHR-BKK-LHR route have been refitted. The seat date from the early 2000's - almost two decades ago, and I had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat. Come on ! Yes I got my amenities kit, a better pillow British papers and pre-departures drinks, a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus. But the seat is old, not that comfy, the IFE belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry. Great sound, good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality. I spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as I could not see squat. The seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty. It was however A bit better out of LHR but still not that great. The meal service was not good out of BKK. Bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack - just a napkin. Main dish was ok, but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke. No cheese nor crackers. Not enough at all, you are left starving, and in economy it is even worst. I have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit. Cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the J/C had a brand new a la carte service as well.  Cabin crew operating both legs were great - professional, approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks. Out of LHR the main meal was this time pretty good, including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert. The only false note was the meal pre-selection. You get served first as they do with special meals - but do not offer you any drinks. You have to wait for a very long time. By then my meal was cold and i sent it back. They did replace it right away, but this was clearly a waste of time. Pre-selecting your meal, means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak. Pax with Special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway. Other than that it was this time a decent meal. Having said that, there was no middle service, which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack. Not acceptable on such a long haul. Funny enough the BKK-LHR feature three meals so why not on the LHR-BKK leg ?. BA could be so much better. They have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right - and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago.

C Down,"✅Trip Verified|  Tel Aviv to London. We arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take. The stories were true, although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport, they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc. There were limited priority options available for First Class passengers, although I suspect that is more down to the airport than British Airways. The lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first, and isn’t really acceptable. If it was just business then it would be ‘fine I guess’ but there is not very much seating, the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited. Even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another, very complicated, machine with all instructions only in Hebrew. At the gate there was the usual ‘priority boarding’ queue as well as the regular queue. But the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all Oneworld emerald, sapphire and ruby members - which is a lot of people! Whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members, there really should be another queue for first and Oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long. The service on board didn’t start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew I got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc, and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front I had to go to the galley and ask. They were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldn’t happen in first. The seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space. Annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing, which limits how much you can watch. It was the Thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch. The food and drinks on board were all excellent, including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well. Aside from the hiccup at the beginning, the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special. It would have been nice to have been referred to by name, which I have had before on BA and with other airlines, even in business class. On arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there, which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick. Overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew, let down only by the ground service in Israel. I used Avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money.",7.0,10.0,"""solid product and excellent crew""",2017-11-20,Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,First Class,Tel Aviv to London,2017-11,yes,Tel Aviv , London
C Down,"✅Trip Verified|  London to Tel Aviv. Arrived at Heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy, but check and security felt like it was 10pm, very easy and quick process (which included regular rather than fast track security as we didn’t follow the signs properly). We used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor, although they did later improve. The food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches, soup and some dry cake. This wasn’t really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty. Drinks overall were good as always with British Airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling. In terms of seating, there was enough for all the passengers in there, and it was quite busy, and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place, although better variety in seating, including some more comfortable chairs, would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising. This biggest failing was the staff in the lounge, which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges. Smiles are free and go a long way, and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality, eerily walking around slightly like a zombie, seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd! The other area which I find completely below standard are the toilets. Whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc, the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room. The regular Heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality. Whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice, there aren’t really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier. On board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin. This meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access. These seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort, privacy and access. Unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife, which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution, selection and even the fact that some screens won’t even stay in place and fold themselves away! British Airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft, end of story! Even the Thales system is showing its age now, but this Rockwell Collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art! The cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience. Some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc, and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly. Others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience. Food and drinks on board were actually quite good, although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet. Overall it was a very enjoyable flight, and as I booked using Avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money.

Fortunately, my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good. The service (KUL-LHR) was brusque. Meal was served not long after take off and my child was already sleeping as it was past midnight. I had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt NO and that they couldn't give it to us later nor would they have any snacks to offer. So if we got hungry we would just have to wait more than 8 hours later for the next meal. Luckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politely. Both aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for us. Some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats. What I didn't like though is that the arm rest couldn't be kept up totally between the 2 seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine. The armrest kind of went up to a max of 80 degree angle. The seat pockets were very small so there's very little that can kept inside.

Christopher Rainbow,❎Not Verified|  Madrid to London Heathrow on a busy Monday evening in November was an entirely mixed affair. Boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed. Boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage. This resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold. Some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff. Every single seat was occupied. This was quite hard on the staff. A trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain UK based TV personalities. This was in English only. The inflight service was very poor. I ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me. Disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage. I regard this as a health and safety matter.

C Stratton,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon. I was flying my return leg back to Korea after a Christmas vacation. I had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return. To start with, i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault. Having not had my selection available on the outbound leg (in business class!) i wanted to ensure i had something for my return. I couldn't pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had AGAIN run out of 50% of the available selections. Quite disgraceful. I was also unable to check in on line, so i was ""directed"" by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work. Eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in. The rest of the airport process after that was smooth. This time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat. This meant that I did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if I wanted to get out of my chair in flight. Of course I had to pay extra $'s for the seat selection in business class - a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin. The flight was uneventful. On this occasion I had a very warm crew for which I appreciated. Overall I still feel that BA is just too cheap on it's product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class. Frankly, even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time I had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier.",6.0,10.0,"""BA is just too cheap on it's product""",2017-11-17,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon,2017-01,no,London Heathrow , Seoul Incheon
C Stratton,"✅Verified Review|  Seoul Incheon to London Heathrow. This was my first flight on BA for many years. As a Brit, I was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for Christmas on board the relatively new B787. I was disappointed. The fare I paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a J class cabin - in my view. However, it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in J class. I do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and I certainly do not appreciate it. I was seated in row 1 by the window. My first experience in this cabin was a shock when I realised I was looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me. And further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to get into and out from my seat. The tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service. Even in row 1, by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out. This left me taking a Korean option on a flight on BA where the majority of the passengers seemed to be non-Korean. Clearly something wrong with the meal ratios. They offer a serve yourself snack bar in flight. I went to the galley at one point and there was very little available to take food wise - it was mostly just drinks. It also seemed to be a fixed meal time - something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers. The IFE selection was nothing more than average. I found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carriers. The service and product simply left me feeling that BA is way behind other carriers and I concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin.",6.0,10.0,"""BA is way behind other carriers""",2017-11-16,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Seoul Incheon to London Heathrow,2016-12,no,Seoul Incheon , London Heathrow

Next to me was somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat. The crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt. So three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hours. The food is awful, poor quality and with poor selection of wines - cheap Spanish wine with no choice, the cabin was over heated.

R Wathardar,"✅Verified Review|  British Airways short haul Business Class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch, with lounge access and a meal thrown in. So is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket? BA recently introduced Business Class on domestic routes and as I got a decent price for booking well in advance, decided to try it out. Checking in was efficient, and the Galleries Club Lounge adequate (no comparison whatsoever with Asian or Middle Eastern Airline lounges). Priority boarding although announced, did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused. Having maneuvered into the cramped seat, I was offered a hot towel as soon as I sat down. I couldn't decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video. It was more spot the stars, than listen to the safety instructions. But I guess it was something different BA was trying out. The service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift. Soon after take off, a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight. The service was good, considering a one hour flight. Despite a Boeing 767, 2x2x2 layout, the cabin felt claustrophobic. To me, this was no different than economy seating, with virtually no leg room. How can this be branded as Business Class?

G Searle,"✅Verified Review|  London to Santiago. Cabin crew generally helpful and friendly. Cabin a bit grubby; crumbs, nuts and grime in evidence. On the flight home as I took my seat I saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight - evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough. The alcoholic drinks were all pleasant. The food was of variable quality (as was the coffee) none bad, some a bit mediocre, some good. Many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and I found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another, sleeping, passenger's legs trying not to wake them up. The other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you can't watch it, as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you. On both flights I found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that I would have to look at it at an angle. I solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit, but then I had to take it out every time I got out of my seat. Another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer. And that adds to the litter problem. After you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin, what do you do with it? Er, drop it on the floor? I did manage to sleep quite well, though the pillow you are provided with is very thin. On the flight back they gave me another one when I asked. Another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket, sweater or whatever, the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer. And I don't want to seem a bit picky, but although the in-flight entertainment has a good choice of films, the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as ""comedy"", ""thrillers"" etc but no A-Z. All in all, it wasn't an unpleasant experience but I would advise BA, if they were interested in my advice, that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re-think the seat configuration.",6.0,10.0,"""need to clean the planes more often""",2017-11-11,Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Santiago,2017-11,yes,London , Santiago

C Ward,"✅Verified Review|  London to Mumbai. The electrics at my seat were not working. This may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etc. - The call button light kept coming on and off on its own. It was impossible for me to control this and at the time that I did actually want to contact the flight attendant, I had to use my husband's remote control to do so. - Because the connection was loose on my remote, it meant that things were changing on my TV screen without me being able to control it e.g. I would press play on the screen, then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything. Because my remote controller was broken, it would not return properly into the socket and kept 'pinging' back out. This was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat. The TV screen was  faulty. The usual 'push and release' button did not work, I had to push the button and then just try to 'pull' the screen, it was very tough. Even the cabin crew could not release it properly. My footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own - my husband had to help every time I wanted to move this. My husbands footrest was  broken - The charging socket at my seat did not work, so I could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight. My husbands charging socket also did not work. the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row. This is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat/row kept opening throughout the flight. The attendant would shut it and then it would  open, this happened during take off and landing, as well as throughout the flight.  For this level of airline and Club World seat, it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment.  This return flight was the first time that I have flown business class.

W Neeley,"✅Verified Review|  Gatwick to Marrakech. Generally a well organised flight and fairly full in Y class. My gripe is about the current food service. This was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. After a lot of comments from others who have flown BA recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board is very limited, especially as much seems to be already 'sold out'. The biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. It took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though I observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing. Of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. Passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengers. I overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. It is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. I remember the days when a British Midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a LHR to Middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an Aer Lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from Dublin to London.

K Gaulin,"✅Verified Review|  Singapore to Nassau via Heathrow. British Airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with. I will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from Heathrow to Singapore on Oct 23. There were bugs on the flight and I have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places. One can suffer the bad food, service / behavior of cabin staff but having one's health compromised is unacceptable. The toilets were filthy. I was in the paid premium seat (front row) and I could smell the toilet from there. The attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason. The food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available. While flying from Nassau to Heathrow, the dinner was fine but the breakfast (I think it was a morning snack), consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump, coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar. I mean, you cant get a croissant right? The inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired. The screens in the Singapore- Heathrow sectors were ok to use but the Heathrow to Nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time. I could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the 'touch screen'; more like punch screen. The flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time. It could learn well from airlines like Singapore Airlines which are pretty consistent and clean.

Flight fine, ahead of schedule and good updates from cockpit. Didn’t buy anything this time, smell of coffee far better than the taste from previous experience. Gatwick South unpleasant tho not BA’s fault. Endless staircases, broken escalator and a long walk to security where half the e-gates were out of action. Baggage hadn’t arrived anyway despite being priority so delay at security irrelevant. Had an offer to upgrade to Club for £89 - a joke as there is no lounge at Bari and the onboard value is a max of £30. I do still like flying BA as much as I don’t Easy or Ryanair.

Clive Drake,"✅Verified Review|  Pisa to Gatwick. I fly this route often as I have a home in Tuscany. Believe me it does not get any better - but the option is Ryanair and that's worse. Flight started in the new South Terminal lounge. The decor and layout of the facility is great. No problems here although it's located in a ""not so easy place"" to find. Breakfast food was ghastly. Cheap baps with greasy bacon or a dried up ""eggy"" thing. Horrible. Didn't touch it and those that did - left it as confirmed by numerous plates with half eaten baps. Had tinned fruit salad and yoghurt plus a G&T. Yes I know, bit early in the day! Short walk to the gate. Plane left on time. the usual horrible 3 for 2 seats in Club Europe. The front row made it easier - but only just. Had a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous salad. The plane was very old. This was confirmed by the WC. Originally the loo flush button was blue. After 100,000 + uses the blue was partly eroded by finger presses, to a grey colour. The loo basin cannot be described here. Plane landed on time. The Captain came out and I had a nice chat with him. Very nice bloke. Return flight started in the shared lounge. It okay but can get busy. Same plane back (recognizable by the flush button in the loo - unless all the BA319s are like it). Skipped the meal as I'd eaten lunch in Pisa. It looked nice though. A few gin and tonics to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product Club Europe is. Great flight back into the setting sun. FAs on all flights were great. Morale very low thanks to the miserable, mean cost cutting by the BA CEO, Mr Cruz, who has no idea on how to run an airline.

The Premium Economy cabin was directly behind First Class, and those passengers kept using the First Class toilets. It didn't matter, because they were filthy. The dinner in First Class was inedible.

C Down,"✅Verified Review|  Faro to Gatwick. Check in was quiet at the club Europe desk and I was very quickly booked in. Fast track security at the airport wasn’t particularly well managed, although I did get through quicker than I would have otherwise. Disappointingly British Airways do not provide any lounge access at Faro, and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge, and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise! There was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual British Airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself. The aircraft was the new style, which I think is very smart and nicely decorated (not budget airline as some commentators like to say), and whilst the legroom isn’t amazing I am 6’ tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space. The cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient. A bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight. All of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent, sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg. That being said it tasted very nice. Arriving into Gatwick was a dream, especially for a large airport. Although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones, they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick. It took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painless.

There was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didn't bother to fetch any. Tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed. No refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley It took 2 days to get through to customer relations, many calls cutting off after 18 minutes +, others cancelled after going through options.

G Peel,"✅Verified Review|  Gatwick to Orlando return. Worst ever long-haul Business Class flight.  We have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which British Airways have descended (not the world’s favourite airline by far). We have never liked BA’s Business Class (Club World) seats since they changed over to the Yin-Yang layout of 8 seats across the cabin. The seat layout together with the poor service, meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever long-haul Business Class flight we have experienced. To this day I have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the CAA regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place. Unless you are sat in an aisle seat, cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous. (True this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head!) In order to get out of the centre seats (rows E and F) and the window seats you have to climb over another passenger’s feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined. In the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over. We are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason. You almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly, often from behind you so by the time you notice them, they have gone. We should not have to use a call button just to get basic service. The return leg was a night flight, the service overall was very poor, the crew just wanted to turn the lights down ASAP. The service at breakfast was also poor, the offerings were inconsistent. My wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin, whereas I at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee. The entertainment system was archaic (very few recent film titles), the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to BA in March 1999 and it shows its age. This flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service. BA are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them. It is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats, you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service. It will be marginally better than being seated at the back; but that does not make it right.

Check in area at south terminal is very nice and I was checked in very quickly, with fast track security equally quick. The new BA lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating, interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac. It was early morning and breakfast was served, which was reasonably good. Although the hot options were just bacon roll, omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited. Staff were all excellent. Boarding was quick, cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered. This was an older aircraft with the old style seating, but the aircraft was clean and didn’t show much sign of age. The seats are comfortable enough, although legroom is not amazing. I was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most. The cooked breakfast was actually fairly good I think, nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients. Disembarkation was quick enough, although bags took quite a while.

On board the aircraft boarding was prompt, a clean sleek cabin. I was seated near the back close to the toilet, which wasn't a problem. Beverage service was okay, everything was over priced, I bought a ginger ale for £2 and it was a cup, which shocked me as it was advertised as a full size can. The only thing that was free on board was water, for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointing. The crew were friendly and helpful but I couldn't help but overhear the crews conversation in the galley on descent into Switzerland.

Crew could barely serve me, ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers.

A Madek,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Istanbul. British Airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers, even loyal ones who have status like myself. The overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline. Galleries South in T5 is large, airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the Sunday I travelled. Drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers - the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients. Onboard it is similarly tired, the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table. Seating is cramped. The cabin crew look dejected and have low morale. Onboard experience the service is no different, than flying easyJet, in fact I would argue worse. There is no complimentary catering, you are subjected to M&S sandwiches. It is not cheap and or good value or any better than LCC offerings. Service is slow and took the whole of 4.5 hours of the flight - meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle - I was even asked to wait until I was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people. The slow service is due to the use of card only payment, and also the fact the supplier doesn't allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down. On the return journey its clear BA doesn't care about its European or non-North American routes - the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar, in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy, but least the food was decent. Overall if it wasn't for the fact I flew with FF miles and the low tax on redemptions within Europe, I would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline - you get better more efficient service on the likes of EasyJet now within Europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed.",2.0,10.0,"""is quite clearly in decline""",2017-10-06,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Istanbul,2017-08,no,London Heathrow , Istanbul
Mike Palmer,"✅Verified Review|  Toronto to London in Premium Economy and onto Oslo in Economy. Easy check in and in the lounge within 15 mins. The usual selection of dry sandwiches, and a chicken noodle soup (minus the chicken and noodle). The lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away. Efficient boarding with sparking wine/soft drinks offered. Early departure, fast drink service and dinner before lights out. There was no breakfast (previously scrapped) with the cereal bar now also gone. Early arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfast. An early departure and an average flight on a A319. Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink. Early arrival though a long wait for bags. Oslo to London on a A320 was verging on a farce, A full flight, selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space. The buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served. Service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life, broke out the paper visa slips, took the cart back in, re-appeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight. Little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases. The crew tried really hard, put a brave face on and kept going. The organisation and concept of the BA buy on board is a disgrace. Though a third party provides the food and card machines, the choice, stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce.  I don't understand why BA continue to struggle with this service as Easyjet, Ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together. Early arrival and fast bags completed the flight. Final flight home to Toronto was good, the club lounge at the B gates remains quiet, clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flying. The 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time. At the gate, the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class. Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. We pushed back over 30 late. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges). Afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic. Overall, the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. The desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times.

T Lanescu,"✅Verified Review|  Port of Spain to Gatwick via St. Lucia was a good experience. I don't have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants, who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks. The seat was comfortable enough, a bit wider than on low cost flights, I had extra space and as I noticed the leg room between seats was regular. I had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room. There was a minor issue, the flight had a stop at St. Lucia, after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row, opened their entertainment system screens, to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from Port of Spain. I told them it's not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time, so this would be something the management should look into. In-flight entertainment was good, with no advertising, which pleased me a lot. I had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat, who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat, sometimes talked louder than necessary, but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers.

I was flying further from Gatwick to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines, hoping I would not have to change airports in London and as a result go through immigration, take the baggage out, check-in again, pass immigration and security again, but BA doesn't have an agreement with Turkish Airlines and I had to go through this lengthy process.",9.0,10.0,"""was a good experience""",2017-09-26,Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,Port of Spain to Gatwick via St. Lucia,2017-09,yes,Port of Spain , Gatwick via St. Lucia
Douglas Day,"✅Verified Review|  Flew London Heathrow to Chicago. Simply appalling. Aircraft was old configuration B-747-400 with Premium Economy adjacent to First Class. Cabin was filthy, and carpets coming up. Food was inedible. The IFE system was old, slow, and low resolution. No wireless of course, either. British Airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service, and sample it themselves. For them to call it ""First Class"" is insulting, demeaning, and arrogant in the extreme.

I still don’t think the buy on board is working that well, but that is not the crew’s fault. We were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal.

B Morrison,"✅Verified Review|  I flew from London Heathrow to Sofia and back. The plane on both flights was an Airbus 321 and I’d guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interior. I am 1.82m (6 feet) tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine – I certainly didn’t feel cramped even in the centre seat. Both flights departed the gate on schedule (although actual take-off on the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of air traffic restrictions over Europe). The cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous. On both flights, the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progress. So far, top marks to British Airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment service. It might seem like a minor gripe but I do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if I have to pay for it (which you do not on other legacy airlines like Lufthansa). The range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines I have flown with. But there the comparison ends because whilst I have always been served quickly (and sometimes twice) on short haul low-cost airlines, BA’s service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too. They also insist on card only transactions. I had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs - and the A321 is a long plane. A single trolley started from the front, making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long, I only just managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and was scuttling to and from the galley, squeezing past the long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories. (The coffee, by the way, was excellent). The return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley, leaving the remaining passengers unserved.

A Wharton,"✅Verified Review|  Heathrow to Bilbao. Boarding of the flight at Heathrow was very good , the flight was on time and the plane was clean. Frequent flyers boarded first and the rest soon followed. From then on the service was very similar to a Easy Jet or Eurowings flight. The 3 crew member's in economy passed through the cabin selling M&S sandwiches , snacks and coffee. The flight out of Bilbao was delayed by a late incoming aircraft, information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agent. However the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed. The flight crew also managed to shave 15 minutes off the flight time too.

The Premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flight.

Onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule. Amazingly when the menu came it contained only an Arabic snack with no options. They say this is to allow maximum sleep. No other airline has done this. Breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible. It is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you can't even get a meal. The airline is clearly failing fast and I wish now I had flown the luxury of Emirates at half the price.

Rob Minter,"✅Verified Review|  London Gatwick to Funchal. In my opinion British Airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom. For travellers in Economy BA are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that. They have failed to understand what their true market is all about. Generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of Ryanair or Easyjet. The BA brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides, but sadly not any more. The choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive. Frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay. And that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left. On our flights to and from Funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin, in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back. Service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink! Maybe that's in the next part of the BA master plan?! British Airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment, not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier, simply lost somewhere in the middle. As a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away. Don't BA management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink? Sadly I think we know the answer. All we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete.",2.0,10.0,"""they are just an embarrassment""",2017-09-11,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Funchal,2017-09,no,London Gatwick , Funchal

Again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co-pilot coming out to chat. Not left wanting the whole flight.

Entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way. On our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind. Again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely. Food was again just ok.

A Ward,"✅Verified Review|  On a flight from Bangkok to London and you'll have some locals and holiday makers that wish to have a taste of Thailand in their meal choices. First meal service has Thai Green Curry (veg) and the second Thai Red Curry (chicken). Really? No one could come up with two Thai dishes that were a little bit more different? So the meal service begins and I was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns. Unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns.  I said, ""I don't want the prawns for starter as I'm having the prawn main meal."" I should not have worried as the prawn salad was off.  Ok so prawns for starter and I'll have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce, mashed potatoes, mushroom, spinach and tomato. Well I'm not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point I wasn't eating them. The chicken breast was dry and I got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it. Mushrooms were very meh, tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible. The bread roll didn't win any prizes either. I just gave up and refused to eat it. Now when this was served I'd been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the FA was off too quickly. No problem, press the call bell. Which is reset before anyone comes. Press it again and think I'd better get on with eating my food. Eventually some one arrives and notices I'm not eating my main course and after I tell them it is disgusting I ask why no one has answered my call button. Obviously I'm just asked what did I want and I say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and I'll have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice. This does not appear for fifteen minutes. During that time I am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isn't going work for me. So a couple of hours later I'm a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where I find some quite pleasant snacks. Back at my seat I think I need a G&T with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin. There is no one in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger CW cabin. I do find one in the second galley. I ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times I've tried to use it and been ignored. Bad service. Now on to the second meal service. Strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu. I ask the FA about this but am just told everyone is having the same, no explanation. The starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing. The dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine. Now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now I have to choose again. Ok main meal, I'm give a choice of smoked salmon again or red Thai curry so no choice really and I decide to give up and go to a restaurant when I disembark.

The flights were smooth and left on time, seating fairly comfortable, consider is was a 80 minute flight. Pre-board and on board announcements were efficient and informative. The downside however, was the in flight food and drinks service which was in disarray. Although BA on European routes have also opted for charging for virtually everything that low cost carriers do, I still expected some efficiency. It was tediously slow, with the attendants pacing up and down the isles to get an item not in the trolley. The glossy M&S menu looked good, but too laborious to get some food and pay for it. With some families split up, paying for items took longer, with some getting impatient and noisy. By the time the trolley reached the back of the aircraft, the descent had already begun.

On my return I felt embarrassed that BA is our national airline, mainly due to the absolutely abysmal meal quality. White fish consisted of 3 tiny pieces of 'fish' surrounded by a brown, fatty unidentifiable, flavourless mass. The tiny token broccoli was a greenish brown mush. Service was efficient, bordering on perfunctory. Luckily we brought some other food on board.

The staff at the gate were friendly and ensured boarding did not take a huge amount of time. The welcome on board was exceptional, however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight (ie, nothing exceptional or poor). The seats looked very appealing, but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortable to sit on after a while. This is a great shame for a good looking cabin. We took off twenty minutes after the intended time, due to a late start to boarding and an extended taxi time. However, the pilots did a great job in keeping us informed to the reason for the delay, and the current progress in making up the lost time.

Flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and BA handling in Salzburg did apologise for the delay. Once boarded with a full flight there were 4 crew members, 2 to serve Club with about 8 passengers and 2 to serve about 120 or more economy passengers. Usual fight for bag space. I was desperate for some water and asked the crew can I buy some water as they dragged the trolley to the front of the cabin. I am in seat 23C right at the back. I am told no, I have to wait for the trolley. I wait and wait and as we fasten our seat belts on descent to Gatwick the trolley gets to seat row 20. The 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments, and tell row 20 that the service is now closed, and pass the trolley back to the behind galley. All this as the CSD stands chatting in the Club galley with the other crew member. 1/4 of cabin not given the chance to even buy a glass of water in a 2 hour dinner time flight. No smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling. Not even a flight map to help pass time. Terrible airline.

B Rawlins,"✅Verified Review|  London City to Dusseldorf return, flights operated on behalf of BA by Eastern Airways. The cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases. Cabin Crew must of been members of the Basil Fawlty school of Catering. The outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us. The young stewardess took our orders, then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal. The meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented. On arrival at Dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal. The arrivals boards in the airport say terminal B and we were dropped off at Terminal C. Our delivered to terminal C and we had to walk to Terminal B if you were been met. The return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that BA is becoming famous for at overseas airports. Check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to LCY and 2 hours before the flight to LHR. I can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf. As the flight to LCY may only have max 100 pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before. The check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on Club Europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle. Which looked totally out of place in uniform. The flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals, which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called Ham & Chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days. Again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has Wizz and Ryanair, in fact they have better staff than Eastern Airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process.  I was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed. On arrival at LCY it become apparent that the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind. The handling agents at LCY could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight. I did phone on Monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system. This morning I spoke to a member of senior management at Dussledorf Airport. About 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport. They will be put on the late flight tonight which means I will get it nearly 4 days after it became missed.

I asked for my bags to be offloaded and I would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate.  The trend for BA in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource Check in Staff who have no comprehension of the BA system, combined with an arrogant ignorance that means I will not be choosing this airline again.

Guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy. British Airways calls their economy 'World Traveller', I wonder if those 'at the top' making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the (much) superior service (most) other airlines offer even in economy? BA take a page from Qantas to see what economy service looks like. My understanding is BA recently lost a star, and are now only 3 stars. Quite understandable from what was offered on this flight! Food, awful, dinner of chicken, rice and peas. Breakfast over Ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars, awful! Even a recent United flight from SYD to SFO served better meals! No return of crew to offer more beverages. And no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer. The wine offering was the best part, a reasonably good Spanish Pinot Gris! There are alternatives to the UK from Canada, Air Canada, Air Transat, Westjet. On Westjet, you purchase your food, but I'm sure it has to be superior to BA's offering! My last flight to Britain on Air Canada was much superior. Air France last October to Paris was excellent! Qantas to Australia, is always brilliant!

All looked good until the gate crew lost control of the gate on seeing the door to the jetway open passengers surged forward and then blocked the entrance while the calls made for First, Gold, Business etc to come forward. It is not pleasant to have to to push forward to get to the gate as a BA premium passenger. One First class passenger told the gate assistant to ""take control back of the gate"". She blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staff. It was a miracle then that the flight departed on time and arrived into Accra a little early. A first for me in 18 years on the route! Once on board the crew on the top deck could not have been more friendly.

BAs use of old aircraft is to blame. A failed IFE that couldn't be repaired took two hours to try and remedy. After this failed, a replacement plane was required. By the time this arrived, BA realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hours. This led to a further 1hr delay waiting for a standby crew. This was avoidable and shows the lack of genuine care pre flight by BA. No refreshments provided, no accurate information, just endless waiting. They didn't board the children first and it was a total mess. The plane could not land due to bad weather and had to divert to Tampa due to low fuel. Whilst this seems fair enough, the plane was actually 1hr late leaving Gatwick in the first place so had it left on time, it might have landed fine and passengers would not have encountered as long a delay as we did.

B Rowden,"✅Verified Review|  San Diego to London Heathrow. The worst business class I have flown in! I flew on the 777 so whilst it's not the newest plane in the fleet, I still expected some level of comfort. The seats are too narrow and do not lie flat. I'm a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat. There is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed, but does not line up with the rest of the seat. So your feet are raised. The armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around. Every time the person next to you moves, your chair moves too. The hydraulics must be connected. It was very annoying. The tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest, it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay put. It was not secure and basically, was flimsy and unusable. I had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap. I was in seat 14A which was a rear facing window seat. There is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you (which is a forward facing aisle seat). The divider has to stay down until you are airbourne. So for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding, you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face. Very awkward! The tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldn't stay put. It wanted to go back into the column and so I had to watch my movie at an angle. The food. Well. The fillet streak was tough and dry. I had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with American Airlines and they did a much better job. The selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice. Service: if you want good service, don't get a window seat. You are cut off from the aisle, and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger, the cabin crew forget you are even there. I had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round, both with dinner and breakfast. The layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head! Not ideal with some turbulence. There was also no wifi even though BA advertise as such. Apparently the Boeing 777 does not have the right equipment. In short, BA have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin. The layout is impractical, seats are narrow, there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger, and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored. The 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly, the TV's stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal.

Flew British Airways from Pisa to London Gatwick. The two of us arrived at the airport exactly two hours before departure. We had hand baggage only and had already checked-in online and had boarding cards on our smartphones so proceeded to security. The queue was pretty hectic and it took 30 minutes to get through. Although we were flying Economy as BA Gold members we had access to the lounge. The lounge was quite dated in design but very comfortable with a good selection of food and beverage for a contract lounge. We left the lounge 45 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control, the queue was long and slow and took 20 minutes to get through. Once through we headed to the gates which was boarding for priority passengers. We received the magic beep and were upgraded to Club Europe (both of us are Gold members). We were seated in row 7, it was the typical 3 seats but the middle seat blocked with a tray installed. Leg room not great but we are both short. After take off we were offered drinks. I had a glass of champagne which was served from a full size bottle. We were then offered afternoon tea, consisting of three finger sandwiches: beef, egg and tuna and a slice of Victoria sponge cake. All very tasty but I do miss the scones in Club Europe. I also managed two top ups of champagne. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when requested.

Alan Wan,"✅Verified Review|  This was a one way Avios redemption flight. Fare cost £17.50 and 7,500 Avios each. As a BA Gold member I used the First class wing at T5, this included direct access to the Galleries First lounge. We were through very quickly as there was no queue at security. The lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch. The former had better food offering, the sausages and mushrooms very tasty. Lunch wasn't very good, I ordered a BA burger, the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate, my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless - she left most of it. The buffet selection wasn't particularly interesting, some chicken, potatoes, veggie curry and chilli. My wife said the curry was okay but the chilli I tried was bland. The drinks on offer were decent, a gin festival was on, although I don't drink the stuff the choice looked extensive. I had a few glasses of Henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful Castlenau they used to have but not as good as the Taittinger they served a year ago. I tried a few sips of a Kiwi Pinot Gris, can't remember what it was called but it was very nice. Finally I couldn't resist a shot of Johnnie Walker Blue. The first class lounge itself needs some TLC, the gents are smelly and unkept and none of the plug sockets worked. I normally try to fly another Oneworld airline other than BA. But if it has to be BA then I prefer to fly from T3 for the excellent Cathay Pacific lounge. In fact I prefer the new BA Gatwick First lounge than the Galleries T5. The flight itself was okay, it pushed back slightly late and arrived at Bologna on time. I didn't bother with the BoB as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in Bologna. Cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the BoB offering. We sat in a pair of two seats next to door 3L. Really appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flight. Due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front and rear doors were used for deplaning, we were one of the last passengers to exit. It was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to get though passport control then a further 30 minute wait for our luggage. Despite a lot of moans about BA on this forum I can't really complain about the overall experience. As a Gold member the lounge access was free.

P Cole,"✅Verified Review|  We did a return trip from Heathrow to JFK and there were only two good things about flying British Airways, you can use the entertainment system from the start and we liked Terminal Five at Heathrow. The rest was disappointing. The outbound flight was completely full so it was delayed in departing, you would expect them to have known this so they would be able to prepare and ensure that the flight left on schedule. There was no apology. The return trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complain. There was only one inflight meal and the only other offering was a bag of crisps or an 18g chocolate bar. It felt like being in school. Cabin crew weren't overly friendly on either journey. Inflight entertainment was fine, lots of films both new and old to watch. We would usually fly Emirates or Virgin but decided to fly BA to give it a go. If you have similar thoughts, don't do it.

Mixed review: we had to rebook suddenly for next-day business class because my wife broke a bone in her shoulder and had to go home urgently. BA cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune. The good: flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful; food was surprisingly good; wheelchair attendants at LHR were wonderful. The bad: A321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked; Boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable, but a seat in the middle of the 4-seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest; LHR connection of 2 hr was barely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer (BA representative said 1 hr would be adequate!) - even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus.

M Keane,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Brussels return. Through work I have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium cabins. If your timing is right the prices reflect this, that is before the “add-on’s”. So be prepared to get on last, be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row, and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are happy to pay more. That way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up, it’s a win. Any flights longer than a couple of hours I strenuously avoid BA if I can - a shame because in some ways I grew up with BA (back in the days of BOAC and BEA).

Meares,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Accra. Flight left nearly two hours late - bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure. This is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags. Ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage. Chaos in economy class. On this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure. When will BA realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board - it is the most delayed flight out of Heathrow because of this poor management. Fact. The ground staff did nothing to control the crowds - simple and polite requests would have helped. The grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers - on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite (even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers). Once on board the crew were friendly and professional. Very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment, poor food and very poor quality seats. The cold/salad options are far better than the hot offering in BA's club class. Still no wi-fi on BA?

Not enough chairs for the evening flights that tend to depart within a few hours of each other. I wasn’t allowed into the First Class lounge despite being a BA Gold List member. So much for loyalty. Was instructed at check in that this was a “sleeper service” and I should eat in the lounge. Not an advisory but an instruction. The Club World food on offer in the lounge for the “dining experience” was overcooked and of very poor quality. Usual Cub World service on BA which involves clambering over people to get out to the aisle, poor food (they did offer food), poor in-flight entertainment, putting the inflight divider down but never putting it back up (BA train your staff if they put the divider down to have the good manners to put it up again) to serve food and drinks. The crew obviously know they are providing an inferior product and act accordingly.

Possibly the least comfortable airline seat I've ever had, with every lump and bump imaginable, and the infuriating headrest which doesn't stay up, slipping down and banging you in the neck every 15 minutes.

This flight left around lunchtime and I would have thought it would be obvious there would be a large demand for something to eat. To add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation. If there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with. I have today received a telephone call from BA following my initial complaint which really served no purpose. It was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesn't help me. A service which was very good before the cost cutting.  'We fly to serve' I somehow don't think so anymore.

BA support and service in Rome was non existent. After take off the cabin crew came around with their trolley of drinks and unbelievably I had to pay £2.30 for a cup of tea despite a 6 delay with no refreshments provided.

M Hart,"✅Verified Review|  Chennai to London. What a mistake, I selected this route for a two reasons, I wanted to try the new British Airways 787 in Club class and the timing. But I have nothing good to say about the whole thing. The lounge at Chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate. Once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what I think should be standard in Business class there is no direct aisle access for the Window seats and if you're in the Aisle seat you'll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat, the layout is quite crazy. The seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how BA have crammed them all in that's the issue. I had the window seat and initially I found it OK, but as it was a very long all daytime flight I had to dim the window and that's the point you can only dim them down, there is no blind, the sun still shines through, OK I accept it's like looking through very dark Sun glasses but it's not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds. I understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by Boeing. It was my second flight on a 787, both were 11 hour plus flights, the earlier one I made was at night so no issue with the window blinds. I've not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft I find myself just as tired after a flight as I would be on any other aircraft. I'm a long term supporter of BA and I'm so upset that BA are going backwards, focusing on profits and ripping off the customer. Sorry BA but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the money, because it won't last, people like me will move on.",3.0,10.0,"""BA are going backwards""",2017-06-27,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Chennai to London,2016-11,no,Chennai , London
R Young,"✅Verified Review|  Flew London Gatwick to Genoa with British Airways. Fast check in at the smart new premium area at Gatwick. Brand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food, drink and magazines, access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal I realize that nothing can be done about that. The gate number was only announced 20 minutes prior to the gate closing and it was 20 minutes away at at fast pace, especially as there was a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevators. On board our Club Europe seats that we had paid extra to choose, something that no other airline that I know of does with a full Business Class fare, was behind the curtain. Overhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 Club Europe passengers had to put their bags further back in the economy cabin without assistance. An engineer was called to try to move the divider and curtain back but it was stuck and remained between rows 2 and 3 with our seats being in row 3. My special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight. Leg room was atrocious for Business Class and seats are the same as economy. Because the curtain could not be drawn, the Business Class toilet was used by Economy Class passengers and at times Business passengers had to queue behind them. Given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great. Had to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at Genoa Airport.

Flew British Airways from Beijing to London Heathrow. The cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. Cut backs are evident everywhere, from the small and very cheap hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other than with other airlines on china and warm - this might seem a small niggle, but it is indication of BA saves costs - by annoying their premium cabin customer). The amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke really. To be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other One World members (Royal Jordanian and Qatar for example). Flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should be more than that. The offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground. Was presented, at the second meal serice, with frozen pawns on bread (returned and a de-frosted plate came by return). Unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea - but no effect as yet. Part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight, I covered it up with a spare blanket. Despite there being enough toilets for Club World passengers there was often a line of people waiting from World Traveller Plus - snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. No control of passengers from World Traveller Plus coming in to the Club World cabin. Toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so I ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. Lovely.

Kenneth Howie,"✅Verified Review|  Leeds to Durban via London / Johannesburg. Check in at Leeds was efficient. Security was slow, so fast track was appreciated. Boarding was relatively quick and flight departed early. Seating was reasonably comfortable but cramped, and service is basically non existent unless one is prepared to pay for food. Transfer at Heathrow was a breeze, surprisingly with no further security check. Boarding commenced in good time and was quick and smooth onto the upper deck, with a pleasant greeting from the crew. The premium economy cabin is very pleasant with good seat width and legroom. The seats are comfortable, but both our seats were faulty. Mine would not stay upright and my wife's would not recline. Unfortunately we did not realise the extent of the problem immediately and only reported it next morning. We were moved to business class - we should have reported it immediately! Sparkling wine and fruit juice were offered before take off, unfortunately the quality has been hit by cost savings. Bar service followed quickly after take off, but again the quality of wines was average and not up to the standard offered by other airline in premium economy. We both ordered beef fillet for dinner - alternative was chicken - which was good and served on proper crockery with decent cutlery. Breakfast next morning was economy class fare with plastic cutlery, which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down the standard and one questions whether the cost saving is really worth the negative impression created. The A380 is very quiet and most passengers seemed to sleep. There were several drink runs during the night, and the cabin crew were quite active. Arrival was on time and everything went smoothly. The final connection to Durban with BA franchise, Comair, was a reminder of the difference between flying in South Africa and flying in Europe.

C Rankin,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Paris Orly. I have been a gold member of BA over 25 years making approx 100 flights per year We have been through ash clouds, strikes, IT breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace. I didnt think it could get worse but it did. Arrived at the airport and my app said on time, screens said on time but my independent tracking app said 3 hours delay. In the first class lounge I was told short delay. Knowing how inaccurate BA can be I asked to speak to special services. One hour later I asked again. I got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty, take it up with Alex Cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity. Unimportant is how I felt after 25 years of Gold guest list. She then told me the flight was cancelled and said I would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement .Staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for Charles De Gaulle no alternative was offered. I had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg BA for a refund which they tried to sidestep. The moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at BA it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the CEO. The other interesting fact is I did look at choices before booking including Easy jet <100 pounds Air France 500 pounds and foolishly I felt loyalty meant something. Not at this airlin . The salt in the wound is that Easyjet and AF got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in France. It is incredible that one airline who carry's the British flag is such a disgrace.

I sat on the top floor of the A380 after being upgraded from World Traveller at the gate, and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from Singapore to London Heathrow. There were two dinner options, chicken tikka or beef fillet, but as I dozed off I missed out. So no food until 1 hour before landing (11 hours later) unless I wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card. I kindly asked for some water, got some orange juice too - didn't want to push it even though I saw a bottle of champagne open in the galley - not worth the risk of a bad reaction. I cannot recommend this cabin based on the high prices they charge.

Mike Palmer,"✅Verified Review|  This was my first flight from Toronto to London crewed by ""Mixed Fleet"". Easy check-in at Toronto Pearson (The BA ground staff are always great in Toronto) with fast track meant I was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport. The lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited (average) wine list. Still too few bathrooms, the seats are tatty, and when busy is not a relaxing place to be. Easy boarding and the first of a few improvements - prosecco now served to London. (used to be only ex London). Fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer. An OK Chicken curry was served but I still don't see it as Biz class food. A choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each. That is where the improvements ended. The morning offering of a cereal bar and T&Cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little BA care about the entire journey customer experience. The crew on this flight were great. Young, junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional. A request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi, but appeared (in glass) without asking as soon as the crew were released - classy and well remembered! The return flight was less good. Drinks served promptly after take off and my pre-booked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray. (Crew member's first flight since qualifying) It took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a WTP tray. The underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and T&C. Customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back (really) as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers. This cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours I need something more substantial than chocolate. Service reduced - yes, price reduced - no! The 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of WTP, the IFE screens are tiny. Mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort. However, the male crew were more aloof, lacked attention to detail and officious. What these (newer) crews miss, was the more informal / laid back service of Long Haul crew - I hope they relax into the role soon! At least the cuts have stopped (not much left to cut I admit) and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show BA have listened. However, the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast US / Canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey. The jury remains out on whether I continue my loyalty to BA and One World - it really depends on what BA do next - to either value me as a customer (and offer a quality service) or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline (at which point - I'm off).",7.0,10.0,"""whether I continue my loyalty""",2017-06-19,Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Toronto to London,2017-05,no,Toron, to London

It's at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff. Boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late. Club Europe on domestic flights is a new introduction. Actually it replaced what was BA economy class. A cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers? The aircraft was pretty full so some people like BA although I suspect many passengers were transferring at LHR. Service was okay food economy standard although included in the price. Arrival at T5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags. I fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90% on long haul flights.

I can now distil the difference in service/product with economy on the same route - with WT+ you will receive one amenity pack (eyeshades, socks, toothbrush), one welcome drink (""cava or water""), one glass for drinking with the first meal, a slightly wider seat (1 inch), minor extra recline (1 inch) and a little extra legroom, as well as a meaty dish for the main dinner (I am vegetarian so picked the vegetarian, which was the traditional BA carby pasta from WT, which was fine). I enjoyed the IFE, the crew were nice and the flight on time. I wouldn't pay a premium of more than £50 for the WT+ experience for this flight, or other WT+ routes.

Neil Solomons,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Vancouver. I am very disappointed by BA's gradual decline. Today I flew in the upper deck of the A380. BA's business class seats, once the best in the industry, are almost the worst. The pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow. This is an unpleasant aircraft, with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengers. In business Class I think that's a poor ratio. The flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly (though I noticed no acknowledgement for being a Gold Card holder), but their interest waned as the flight progressed. It took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was served. The beef was cold as were the vegetables. It was actually inedible. I suspect it had just been left out. After dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and I was never offered another drink. I gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight. British Airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines I have flown recently.

M Simpson,"✅Verified Review|  I took a long daytime flight from Tokyo to London (about 12 hours). The Boeing 787 seemed fairly new and was clean, and the Premium Economy seat is fairly comfortable for a day flight, with good recline, although unfortunately there is no legrest and a large entertainment box uses up much of the foot space. The catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of very tough beef, accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen; there was then nothing for nine hours (no snacks available anymore) until a second hot meal, of a small chicken curry, was served shortly before landing. A choice of drinks was offered only once, shortly after takeoff; during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice, but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else (I asked for more water but the crew said they didn't have any). By the time we landed I was hungry and thirsty, and I would advise anyone using this flight to bring their own food and drink. The crew were invisible for most of the flight.

Seat back screens unbelievably small. What shocked me most is just how much BA have cut back on their food service. No bag of pretzels with the first drink serving anymore. Dinner was only two choices and one was a vegetarian option. The chicken breast I received was laughable. I have seen bigger chicken nuggets. This came with a inedible salad concoction and a bread roll. The only other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for 'afternoon tea' with a miniscule scone. My advice would be to eat before your flight otherwise you will be very hungry. Staff were miserable and on the return leg kept me awake all night by talking very loudly in the galley.

Kathleen Kirby,"✅Verified Review| We flew out of terminal 5 on Saturday with British Airways to Brussels, and found everyone to be very helpful and friendly, we even had a nice chat with a pilot as we went up in the lift to departures. We got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous days behind them. We used the lounges as we have a silver card, and they were busy, but well staffed, and the food was good. On the aircraft we took our own home made sandwiches since we really didn't fancy the Marks and Spencer prices. I bought a bottle of water close to our gate, and thought that was expensive enough, but the BA on board water was £1.80 per bottle. I did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water. Like many, I can't get used to this budget airways approach, it's clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good. On our return, we had big delays due to the storms in southern England, and air traffic restrictions. Then, we had Brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure. At all times, the first officer kept us well informed and we got back to London and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up.

W Leeson,"✅Verified Review|  London to Johannesburg. After getting caught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend IT fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by BA, I approached my flight back to the UK with some trepidation. My fears were not unfounded. As the aircraft had been sitting at JNB for most of the day, there were no delays and boarding started very early. I was seat 83A (top deck, double seat) and the leg room was no better than you would find on a Ryanair flight to Dublin. Indeed, due to the location of the electronic equipment box under the seat, it was a little more cramped. The service on BA flights really is terrible. I, along with many other passengers, was treated like an inconvenience and I felt the cabin crew would really have preferred it if we weren't there. I was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due, in part, to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff.

No nuts or nibbles and the drinks were dispensed from open bottles, the miniature wine bottles apparently dispensed with now. There was a choice of meals but you weren't told unless you asked. The meal service no sooner served than it was being cleared away. Altogether we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airline. The advantages of booking club have gone, the lounges being dreadful with little choice of snacks, the priority labels mean you bags come off last, and you only get priority boarding if you scramble past the queue.

This is a monumental con. Also, imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria, and that is what you get in the BA lounge at ORD.

Colin Boakes,"✅Verified Review|  I am shocked about how the First Class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier. On our flight to Tokyo Narita from London Heathrow we were advised by the Cabin Crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were 'limited'. To cut a long story short, this meant that my partner, who was the last to be served, was told what was available rather than asked what he would like. This is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin. For breakfast prior to landing, we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served. The presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description BA uses for its First Class catering. We spoke to the Cabin Services Manager who was extremely apologetic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting - apparently at the behest of the new CEO who comes from low cost sister airline Vueling, with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers. The famous First Class Tasting Menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident - even the rose in the First Class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that BA has become. I fly regularly long haul with KLM & their new Business Class offering is now far superior to BA's First. How can our national airline, with whom we should be proud to fly, compete with other superior European & Gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers? The Cabin Services Manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 May. Almost a month later, although immediately acknowledged, BA have not responded, probably due to more administrative cost cutting. I should add that the ground service at Heathrow T5 & the Concorde Room were very good but as regards on board service, BA offends their premium passengers like this at their peril.",1.0,10.0,"""very evident cost cutting""",2017-06-02,Boeing 787-9,Couple Leisure,First Class,London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita,2017-05,no,London Heathrow , Tokyo Narita

D Lewis,"✅Verified Review|  Choose a budget airline, the magic of our national carrier has gone. We have always chosen British Airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now it's on par or lower than other low cost carriers. Firstly we didn't get any priority boarding with our two young children. EasyJet provides this. Secondly, we reserved seats as travelling with our two children, they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows. On boarding we were told the plane has changed, therefore we now had assigned seats. Thirdly, after paying over £10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife I needed the loo, first class was out of bounds. So the only option the rear of the plane, however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past (I guess those drinks they were selling had the BA executive team seeing many ££££ so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority). After a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past, but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane. A crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea. Our flight from Heathrow to Bergen was only an hour and 40, but I spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member. The return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology. The safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off, the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof, asked the crew - ""Cabin crew, seats for landing"". The captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight, even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with 'that landing'. All minor points, but they were the points we enjoyed with BA, points that made us choose them, small points that made the difference. The pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them, the cabin crew that always went over and beyond. The free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get, I'd rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline. Gutted our British Airways national carrier has become a budget airline. Perhaps cost savings are needed, but for now, although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture, they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead.

Craig Cain,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Seoul return. I booked my return flights back in January when BA were having their annual sale for around £1700. Thought this was a bargain as they are usually up around £3000. London to Seoul flight was very pleasant. Didn't get to use the business class lounge in Heathrow as my connection from Manchester was delayed by 40 minutes. Cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive. Food and drink was what you would expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of high-quality menu choices. The seat layout of 2-3-2 with seats facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped. The seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some, however there is a fold-down seat/step in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully. I'm 6'0 and found I was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable. Inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releases. Toilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that I've flown business class with before. The only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and I found it difficult to sleep because of this. Seoul to London was what really let BA down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing 3 months in Korea. In the days leading up to the flight, BA's ""massive IT Failure"" and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant I was having to frantically check if my flight would be leaving at all, with the flights on the 27th and 28th being cancelled completely. Luckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flight. The flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so take-off was delayed by 30 minutes. I had a connecting flight to catch to Manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as I had just over an hour after landing to make it. The flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job. The pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduled. However, due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days, there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to park. This meant a delay of 20 minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free. This was time I could not afford to lose. We eventually disembarked at 14:45 which meant I had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaim. Really wish I hadn't as it still took 20 minutes for the bags to come off the plane. By the time I had done all this and gone through arrivals it was 15:15 and the gate was closing in 10 mins. Talked to BA customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the IOM (where I live) from London City but they could only book me on the 14:50pm flight the next day. Wasn't at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay (over £3,000 when not on sale) it really wasn't worth the hassle for me personally.",3.0,10.0,"""wasn't worth the hassle for me""",2017-05-30,Boeing 787-8,Business,Business Class,Seoul to London,2017-05,no,Seoul , London
R Warren,"✅Verified Review|  Gatwick to Lima return in Business Class. No choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra (I understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying £50+pp per flight if you aren't is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). By the time we were able to check in, there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together. New BA lounge at LGW smart but packed out at the start of Easter holidays. Limited food offering at breakfast - no hot food at all, unless you count lukewarm pastries. FA service on flights in both directions was good, though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services, despite it being a day flight. Food and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time they got to us. Seating layout of 2-4-2 in business class is very cramped, especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating I've ever experienced in business - and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open. Small drawer at your feet. Recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you're travelling solo - no legs to climb over! Lie-flat seat was comfortable though for a short person. IFE was poor compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available. On the way home we didn't mind a long layover at LIM as we thought we could use the lounge. No such luck - we couldn't be checked in all the way through from LPB so had to pick up luggage, go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in the flight home. Only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair. Very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me, otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger! Haven't travelled long-haul with BA for several years and can only describe it as a functional, value service, even in Business, though it's not cheap. I'd only use BA again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from London), or for a great price on short-haul.

When we got our luggage we discovered that one of the suitcases was damaged. At HND Japan Airlines is the agent for British airways and as it cost time to explain everything. Their service was great. They filed a report to BA and when we are back from the journey we should contact BA to claim the damage. We did and within a few days we got a really extensive response and were compensated.

Ian Robinson,"✅Verified Review|  Antigua to Gatwick. Check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient (better than Gatwick) and although we had a slight delay at immigration, we were soon airside. The new lounge was really comfortable and although we didn't use it (it was dark when we were there) they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa's etc. The bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food. Boarding was on time. On board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife's TV nearly falling off its mounting. Fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious. Push back and departure was exactly on time. Within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. Unlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles. The food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. I can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible. To be quite honest I felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and I almost expected them to say 'I want you to go to sleep now and I don't want to here a sound out any of you until the morning'! Now I know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of the day (or night) they are working and are getting paid to do so. In my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers, it would improve the flight considerably. Breakfast was OK although I seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful I understood why. In a blind tasting I probably would have guessed I was eating rubber bands. We arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim, our cases were waiting for us.

P Andrews,"✅Verified Review|  I was pleasantly surprised with British Airways on both outbound and inbound flights from Orlando to Gatwick after reading the reviews. I would go as far as to say I would choose them over Virgin now unless there was a dramatic price difference. The crew both ways were friendly and really helpful, I have found Virgin crew to be a bit up themselves thinking they are a cut above the rest. Contrary to how Virgin crew are on an overnight flight (serve food, dim lights and keep out the way until hour before landing) BA crew still regularly came round making sure everyone was ok and if anyone wanted anything. We had nearly 3 hour delay leaving Orlando on G-VIIU, firstly due to inbound being a bit late due to an alligator closing the runway and finally a medical issue on board whilst positioned on runway to go. We returned to gate for paramedics, top up of fuel etc and departed at 20.20 versus 17.35. Throughout the crew were fantastic bringing drinks round and keeping us all informed. Whilst the interior of the leisure fleet of 777 is a bit on the tired side it was still comfortable I can recommend 24D as there is no PAX seat behind just a crew seat so no issues with being kneed in the back. For economy class leg room was good. Food was fairly decent for aircraft food.

Ivan Oscar Sterza,"✅Verified Review|  London to Santiago de Chile. Surprisingly pleasing flight onboard Boeing 787, decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the B787 is - or looks - far lighter and wider than any B777 I've been travelling on (could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the ""cocoon"" look less cramped). Even the seat looks wider, while the IFE screen is wider with a higher resolution. The odd ""ying-yang"" layout is slightly better on Boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats, therefore you won't share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there. So first impression better than usual; unfortunately the soft product remains way below par (I pre-ordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available, but the beef was overcooked and chewy), I will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous - sort of a blue shoe bag, too small to fit shoes though. The crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual. Overall the experience was better than usual - mainly thanks to a newer, quieter aircraft - but BA is not improving where they should, in those details that make business class something worth EUR3,000 spent.

We were scheduled to fly to Amsterdam on the 1st of Feb at 07.45, there was a radar problem in Amsterdam.

Ian Robinson,"✅Verified Review|  Gatwick to Antigua. This was our first time in quite a while travelling from the South Terminal and the first impression was that the BA check in area was a little cramped. It was quite busy at the CW check in with about five couples in front of us but as there were four desks open, we were through in about five minutes. The fast track security was quiet and we were soon in the new lounge. This is a huge improvement from its predecessor in the north terminal with nice views, comfortable seats and reasonable food (I had a small bacon roll and a very strange omelette roll?). The departure gate was quite cramped with not enough seating for all of the passengers but as the flight was on time, it didn't really matter. We had made the decision some time ago not to pay an additional cost to select our seats prior to the 24 hour check in as this would have cost up to £340 for my wife and I, depending where you wanted to sit. However, we were pleasantly surprised with the seats we were allocated as we would probably have chosen these anyway. After boarding we were offered a glass of sparkling wine, which for a change was pleasantly chilled. The staff were generally friendly, especially a young guy who said it was his first long haul trip. Once airborne we were offered two drinks with nuts before lunch and then more drinks with lunch. We had pre ordered our food so we knew what we were getting although the quality was just OK (I ordered a chicken curry which was rather bland). The interior of the plane was rather showing its age with stains on the carpet with an overall drab ambience. Also, the IFE seems to be getting worse and unusually my wife found it difficult to watch a film due to the poor resolution. Afternoon tea was OK although no provision was made for my wife's sandwiches (she is a vegetarian) so we had to mix and match between the two of us. We landed on time in Antigua.

Calum Astin,"✅Verified Review|  BA12 onboard British Airways A380 for the gruelling 13 hours from Singapore to London Heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passengers. I'd like to be biased to BA - I'm silver member and British and it's my national carrier but come on let's get to the chase. This route is now also served by Garuda and Singapore and I can say BA are at the bottom of the list for the economy service. Seats are really uncomfortable and near impossible to find an angle to get some rest, the pillows are wafer thin - like sitting on a a bunch of tissues bundled together. Food is lousy and they have removed the silverware and dinner extras like crackers, chocolates and other things that you can snack on. They close down the rear galleyway and turn it into their personal hang out area instead of a self service drink and snack zone like other airlines. This also means you are stuck in your aisle which is frustrating when you want to get to an unoccupied toilet in the other aisle and your toilet section has queues. Further toilets are not regularly cleaned and soap ran out half way through the flight and wasn't refilled. BA have downgraded their economy service in all areas and you feel like the crew treat you like a poor peasant - polite and respectful but minimum effort. On the plus movie selection is great and TV on the A380 is good but not in Singapore Airlines league. Your air miles earning for this route is more generous than Garuda and Singapore. I Would recommend premium economy if you can or If you have to make this route try and get upper deck where configuration is 2-4-2 rather than 3-4-3 downstairs.

There were no complementary snacks offered, we had to pay £60 each on top of that for our luggage to be added to the hold. The only reason we flew British Airways was because we had a connecting flight from Heathrow with another airline. British airways use the excuse for the high fair and no frills because of the ""fees"" they have to pay at Heathrow. I don't buy it though. Our connecting flight from Heathrow cost £420 each and was a 14 hour flight. Yet a 1 hour and 30 minute flight with BA costs £220 each.

Clive Drake,"✅Verified Review|  Newark to London Heathrow. You have to be very careful when choosing a flight to New York. Most of the JFK flights are 20+ years old Boeing 747-400s - prone to breaking down on the tarmac. The 747 ""New 1st"" is so cramped and I avoid any 747 flight whenever possible. I deliberately choose Newark as it is served by a new Boeing 787. Coming back we were on one - with just 8 seats in 1st Class. Its not bad, a bit better than the Boeing 777 - but nowhere close to Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. The lounge is a shared one with Cathay Pacific. Its ok, but apart from a ""1st"" dining area, 1st class passengers are bundled in with Club passengers. It is a nice set up though. Boarded on time and had dinner. Tasteless starter of prawns and fennel. Horrible soup. Chicken mains was ok. Wines ok. The bed was made up and I slept for a few hours. We were not stacked for once and landed ahead of schedule. Plane seemed pretty empty and Club was very empty. Club is a lousy set up and the seat is appalling.

Clive Drake,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Newark. We had heard a lot about the BA First Class ""wing"" at LHR and after checking in we made our way through it - directly from the check in area. The security and screening area is prompt and you find yourself in the First of the BA 1st Class lounges. If you did not know about the more exclusive ""Concorde"" lounge you would probably plonk yourself down here - as the check in staff did not mention the better lounge. The first one was rammed - end to end and we negotiated our way around the bags and carry on luggage strewn all over the place. The Concorde lounge was half empty and we had breakfast in the dining area. It was okay. The lounge is long, long overdue for a refurbishment. The Boeing 777 was parked at the B terminal and we were shown to our seats by a friendly FA. Champagne was served and for once it was chilled. The cabin looked a little tired and I suspect the plane was one of the first to have New First. We had the new Liberty branded wash bags which was light years ahead of the tacky bags we had last December. No amuse bouche - and no flowers in the WCs. There were nine passengers in First - and with an average spend £3,000 - one way, the total revenue would have been circa £36,000. Well done BA, you saved £10 for two bunch of flowers in the loos and 9 x £5 for the amuse bouche - grand saving of the operating costs a massive £55. Lunch was chosen from the cheap tacky menus (Pizza Express is better quality) - and my eyes popped as I read the lead appetizer, and I quote: ""Loch Fyne Kinglas smoked salmon with Oscietra caviar, Burford egg, shallots, creme fraiche and chive cress."" Oh my goodness - Caviar. My excitement was short lived. I had caviar alright - but just five eggs. (Yes folks 5 eggs, not 5 grams) You had to laugh. The soup was horrible. The salad never arrived. The main cod fillet and cod cheeks was very good in indeed. Wine ok. FAs all fine. We landed ahead of schedule - and whoever landed the plane was a zen master pilot.

Clive Drake,"✅Verified Review|  London Gatwick to Pisa. I fly this route often and this flight was my first out of the South Terminal. Its not as ""user friendly"" as the North - and meanders around, up and down - all over the place. Could also do with a refurbishment. We approached the new BA lounge, which is easy to miss not being in the best place in the Terminal, with reservations as everything BA does nowadays is cheap and skimpy. Pleasant surprise - its pretty top notch. Good food and plenty of booze. Nice and airy with spacious seating. We wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge. All good so far. Then the flight was called and our new found love affair with BA quickly receded. The walk to the gate was miles, it took us 15 minutes - and needed a bit of a run as well. Arrived all nice and sweaty. Plane was busy and we had the front row (the best seats). Usual disappointment with the lousy seats - economy masquerading as business seats. Plane old and dirty. The WC was disgusting - dark and dingy and the ""bowl"" - well, I dare not even try and describe it here - save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it - leaving a permanent effect. Took off on time. My wife had the sandwiches - which she said was dry and tasteless. I settled for a couple of Gin and Tonics. You don't expect much nowadays from BA and therefore you are disappointed - before you get a chance to be disappointed. Crew were fine - and don't like the BA cost cuts. As one said ""we spend half the flight apologising to passengers."" They also said charging economy customers for food had gone down like a lead balloon.

S Dawkins,"✅Verified Review| Singapore to London Heathrow - after reading the negative reviews and the press about BA of late, I was not expecting much at all from this trip. Terminal 5 is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with BA, we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutes. We secured seats on the upper deck of the A380, which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck. Seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine. BA cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey, lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft, no hello from her or acknowledgement. Once we got to our seats, there was no space left in the overhead lockers, no help from cabin crew but didn't expect any either, they just looked on and told us where not to store our bags. Food was kept to the bare minimum for this 13.5 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast, nothing in between. I was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast. We got more food and snacks on our Qantas flight from Singapore to Australia, which was much shorter at 7 hours. I still cannot understand how BA are considered a 4 star airline! Qantas also a 4 star airline was much better! In all I was not disappointed with BA, as I prepared myself for the worst.

S Lennon,"✅Verified Review|  Bangkok to London Heathrow. Boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all. The flight was packed full. The inflight entertainment system didn't work for the entire flight - this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly 14 hours. I have noticed that BA don't seem to care about IFE not working on BA0009 and BA0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers. The captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasn't the cabin crews fault, they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction. He explained that the system had overheated - well that calms things! I do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous BA0009 flight I never want to experience again, so I was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available, however I was told they had been withdrawn - I was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry. I managed but remembered how well EVA air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals! The cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets. Passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them. I have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern. ie blocking doors? I also experienced sinus problems, pain and congestion which is I believe due to the air quality on Boeing 777 airplanes, the air being very dry with little humidity. I do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches, sinus pain and congestion. I only experience this after flying on 777's and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems. The captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable. I complained to BA and also emailed CEO Alex Cruze having been urged to do so by the crew. My email to the CEO was forwarded to customer services, no surprises there. Customer Services who replied quickly, investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks. I was advised that the lack of IFE would be investigated by their maintenance team. They would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but I didn't expect them to. By way of compensation I was given 3000 Avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers, they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where Avios are accepted! Frankly I am disappointed in both the flight and BA's level of compensation, I have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route. The only way to check is to fly that route again with BA, do I risk it ?

G Leader,"✅Verified Review|  Belfast to Seoul via London Heathrow. Pretty poor. Short haul connection to London was good, before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul. Flight from London was very cramped, I'm slightly above average height but by no means a giant and I really struggled to get comfortable. Seat was too narrow, very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what I assume was the processor for the IFE system for the seat in front. The seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours. The food was ok, nothing special. Not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough. As a child I remember the food on BA flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong. Staff are one of the few things BA has going for it at the minute, one of the few things left from the BA of old when it was actually worthy of the name. Friendly staff on the flight and in the airport. Flew the same route with Qatar Airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league. One last note, you build this terminal 5 which is meant to be ""world class"". Firstly there is no smoking area, although we're constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to. You expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we can't even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as you're normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in.

Ivan Sterdza,"✅Verified Review|  Buenos Aires to London. I was warned that BA had gone downhill, but I decided to give it a try on this long haul flight. To start with, you cannot reserve your seat prior to check-in, unless after paying over 2000€ for a business class ticket you are willing to spend some additional 90€ per leg to have your seat reserved. I call this insane, to be honest. So I waited and waited and waited till check-in opened, and made it to get a forward facing aisle seat. LATAM Lounge in Buenos Aires was nice, food average but connecting from Santiago I had the time to take a shower, with ground crew extremely nice and attentive. Boarding was sort of a mess, as BA let frequent flyers (not flying Business) board through the Business class door, so there was a flood of people moving back and forth to get to the rear of the plane; crew simply unable to handle this process, so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding. Aircraft was a 3-class Boeing 777-300 and looked a bit ""tired"". Seat was the absolute worst part of this flight, as it is narrow, too hard to have a nice sleep, and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having a ""wall"" on one side and being exposed to people/trolleys passing through the aisle on the other side; once flat it is a little short too (even for me, I'm 180cm high, no giant here) and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side; in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible, therefore you have literally no space to store anything, not even your glasses if you wear them. Food was just ok (I still can't understand how BA can run out of entrée options in Business class), crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice, it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working. Entertainment system made me smile a bit, as the selection of movies was ok but the screen was much smaller than some other carrier Economy class ones. To sum up, it was an average flight, if it was not for the lie-flat seat I would call it more a Premium Economy experience than a Business one. BA needs to improve Business class as they are well below par if compared to almost all European carriers, not even to compare the Middle East airlines.",5.0,10.0,"""warned that BA had gone downhill""",2017-04-22,Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,Buenos Aires to London,2017-04,no,Buenos Aires , London
G Rawson,"✅Verified Review|  Gatwick to Pisa. Check in at Gatwick a breeze. Chaotic boarding process though. Flight took off approximately 10 minutes late. The cabin crew were exceptional and are one thing that BA have going for them. Middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seats and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room. As for the catering. BA are getting this wrong. Why are they insisting on dumbing down on their once reasonable standards. I hardly call 'cheese on toast' a satisfactory meal choice. Despite calling it Croque Monsieur it is still cheese on toast what ever way you look at it ! I hope Mr Cruz reads these reviews. It is not what the customer wants.

B Parkes,"✅Verified Review| Stuttgart to London with British Airways. How things have changed. Passengers now queue at gate as with easyJet or Ryanair, rather than sitting and waiting to be called. Unsurprisingly, boarding in Stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic - unsure who was entitled to what. Cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced, probably because older members have left in view of the transformation of British Airways to a budget airline. How visible this was! Few people bothered to purchase the over-priced snacks and drinks on offer. Once that was out of the way, the three cabin crew members gathered in the rear galley, chatted, and munched away at the spare food from the Business Class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear. At the rear I noticed that one of the two lavatories for Economy Class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window. Directly opposite the one remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy - not least because of the constant queues alongside them. Everything about British Airways now is shabby, telling passengers how little they are valued. And this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservations. My ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat, but at the appointed time there were only four choices left.

This is even more important now, since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the 'stewardship' of Señor Cruz. It started badly when we discovered (once more) that the flight was not at the terminal, but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus, just like a charter flight. I asked a staff member why this was so, to be told that the terminal was too small to cope, but I noticed low cost carrier Norwegian was parked on a jetty. We had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal - those at the rear of Club often have no option due to catering limitations. Passengers were offered a choice of a curry, I think (yum) or salmon (yuck). By the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left. This is high in potassium, a fish I must avoid. I asked why the other dish had run out by the second row? ""Only two were loaded"", was the reply. ""What; two only, for the whole of Club?"". ""Yes"". I asked what else was on board, only to be told that I would have to pay £3 for an M & S sandwich from economy. Before some help from our Avios, the tickets cost £500.00. It was beyond belief that an Executive card holder should be treated this way. The (very nice) cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed.

The layout of the business class cabin is so bad with half the seats facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not up, the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to get up from them. In more than 50 years of traveling, I have not been in a worse business class. The selection of films and music is limited and the screen small. The food on the two trips was passable but nothing more and the wines less than passable unless you like plonk. I do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment but they did not one thing more than was absolutely necessary, I have saved the best for last because on the return flight the temperature of the cabin was close to freezing and I wore two pullovers and a blanket and was still cold.

L Raymer,"✅Verified Review|  Washington to London Heathrow return. British Airways seems to be having an identify crisis. Are they a full service or a low cost carrier? The meals have been cut back to almost nothing. Seat selection fees abound. And checked baggage fees may apply, depending upon the the type of ticket purchased. United Airlines now has a better trans-Atlantic coach product than BA. Food: On the outbound overnight flight, breakfast has been reduced to a granola bar. On the return flight, dinner was tiny. Small amounts of food in half-filled bowls, presented on a large tray, as if to emphasize the lack of food. And the pre-landing snack has been replaced with the aforementioned granola bar. Given the lack of food, BA should just switch to buy-on-board, so at least fewer people would go hungry. Flight crews seemed apologetic about the lack of food. Seat fees: I don't know of any other ""full service"" carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket. Just assume it will cost you another $40 or more per ticket on BA. Luggage fees: Completely opaque policy. On our outbound trip, we were told our tickets included one free checked luggage item. On our return we were told checked bags would be extra, although the kindly baggage check-in attendant waived the fee for us (no doubt, he too is as much a victim of BA's indecipherable baggage fee policy as are passengers). Entertainment: Boeing 777-200 outbound with good, modern, on-demand IFE system. On the return a Boeing 747-400, the system was an older on-demand system, with small blurry screens that were almost unwatchable. Cabin crews were generally friendly.

The seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines. My most recent flight back I took an aisle seat for a change. The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flight. They really don't appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class.",1.0,10.0,"""I am ever increasingly disappointed""",2017-04-18,A320,Business,Business Class,LHR to IST,2017-04,no,LHR , IST

BA have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appalling. There's just nothing positive left to say about them. From the newly refurbished 747 that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats, to the disgusting cheap meals. The flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they're embarrassed and have nothing to offer. All this would be fine but British Airways still charges premium prices and for what? I just took a flight on the same route with Virgin Atlantic and what a difference! All the little extras that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices are cheaper.

Ed Postal,"✅Verified Review|  London to Milan Linate. I landed in London after taking connecting flights from Orange County California to Dallas and then Dallas to London both on American. I landed in London at 1:15 P.M. This flight did not leave until 6:30 P.M. I went to the British Airways help desk and asked if I could get on the 3:00 flight. They told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as I had only one carry one and nothing checked. I went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as I would have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket. So I had to wait another 3 hours. I have now been traveling for 18 hours. At the gate for boarding they looked at the bag and said I would have to check it. I explained that it is a regulation carry on bag and it was on the last two flight and I have had the same bag on over 30 flights as carry on. I explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and I have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as I will be getting in late. They were very rude and tagged the bag but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and get on the bus to the plane. I decided to carry it on to the plane. It fit easily in the overhead as it has for every other flight (there were other bags that were bigger than mine. They actually came on the plane and took the bag off and put in in the cargo hold. If that wasn't annoying enough, I could not believe I asked for water to take a pill and they charged me for a bottle of water. They also charged the woman next to me for a cup of tea. I could understand this possible on one of the discount airlines but this was British Airways.

I have a gluten allergy and need to order special meals. All three gluten free meals on this trip were among the best I have had. All three included flavorful sauces, which is something LH always omits from its special meals. The Galleries lounge in the B satellite terminal was excellent. Not as much food on offer as in the LH and OS lounges, or even the new UA lounge at Heathrow T2, but it was quiet and comfortable. And we really liked the quirky Club World business cabin. The middle section is great for couples, every seat has a storage drawer and the entertainment system was solid. There were four toilets for business class. My only complaint: the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats together in business class.

Despite being in economy class, the flight attendants were attentive and also proactive (serving our needs before we even needed to ask). They were friendly and made us feel completely at home. The on-board entertainment selection was very extensive, with high-quality options (English and international movies of high caliber) and the screen interface was modern and easy to use. The seats on the flight from HKG-LHR on the Boeing 777-300ER were new, and much more comfortable than the average older seat. The pilot was incredibly descriptive of the flight path we were taking, and kept us up to date in terms of turbulence, arrival time, weather without being overbearing or overly disruptive. With regards to the pre-boarding/ground service, one of the check-in representatives went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and I so that we could sit together and have a window seat (both of which were not available at check-in due to the fact that we had bought our tickets separately and had not selected seats beforehand). We really appreciated her willingness to look at what she could do to make our trip more pleasant.

G Graham,"✅Verified Review|  Flew London Gatwick to San Jose Costa Rica. We have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in British Airways. The service on this flight was appalling. Travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services i.e. drinks, towels etc.. the normal routine stuff. On too many occasions we had to request attention. Chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service. Collection of waste items had to be requested. The galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site, no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water. Cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight. Hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp. Toilet bags are cheap. BA have totally lost the plot. They are no longer a premium service and Willie Walsh and Co. need to take a flight on Emirates, Qatar etc. to realise their failings. Business seating configuration is ridiculous. Passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs. As part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect. Again service is in reverse but the costs aren't. If BA wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares. I don't think they have a clue what they are doing.

I do understand why some fare structures mean that flights are not changeable, but BA were absolutely no help at all. They flatly refused to change the flight so I had to buy a ticket in the only available class - World Traveller Plus. Which cost $3,300 - one way. The first class fight to was OK - nice cabin crew and good food, but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting - no snacks, water etc in the galley like there used to be. Absolutely no help on the return trip - despite requests before the flight - because I was walking with a stick. I'd requested an aisle seat, had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passengers as I tried to get across them to go to the loo etc with my stick. Really poor value at $3,300 and rubbish seats, uncomfortable and tv screens that aren't great. The food was awful - clear that costs are being cut massively. Maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful! It's a pity really. It's obviously BAs call if they want to be a no-frills airline, but I'd rather they were honest with us so that we can choose amongst the many other no frills airlines. But they keep trying to say that BA is a leading brand with strong values when clearly they've decided to cut costs wherever they can but still charge high prices.

D Lewis,"✅Verified Review|  Philadelphia to Edinburgh via Heathrow in January 2017. I've always enjoyed flying British Airways and usually make my yearly trips to Philly with them rather than flying direct to Newark via United. The long haul flight was OK - food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was OK for an economy class flight. However, it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning - so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight. I wasn't too fussed about that, until I got on my connecting flight to Edinburgh where I found out that they no longer served free food! By this point, I was pretty hungry so I caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll, which never happened because the trolly never reached me! To top it all off, we left Heathrow late because of a computer problem, meaning I missed my train connection in Edinburgh - but I understand that these things happen at times. However, recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make BA a lot less attractive. Furthermore, the headphone jack on my IFE was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight, which was disappointing. On the up side, the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as always. Considering I got the flight for a good price, it was OK. Although I will definitely not be going out my way to fly BA and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future. I'm indifferent in recommending flying with BA - if they suit you best, then go ahead.

Yes British Airways are investing but long overdue. The small lounge for B gates needs to be re-thought and offer better food options. To the aircraft - its been refitted apparently, but should be scrapped. The seats remain tired. The vanity screen was not working properly. The entertainment system is past its best, with smudges and scratches. The carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed. The toilets are 'old'. Overall, the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium. Regarding the crew - they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves. Sad but true. Too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management. On this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing e.g. Waitrose fruit and yogurts. They have also stopped the ice-cream. Food served was not good - saving grace was the meat platter, but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese. Blankets are faded and ragged. The toilet bags are a joke. Cheap and nasty. This route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder. BA need to invest in a new fleet. Re-energise the crew.

I changed from Lufthansa to British Airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. Mostly flying between Berlin, the US and in recent years very frequently Cape Town. BA had more modern planes, innovative products like a great (rather new) First Class, lie-flat seats in Business Class, a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom. Flying from Cape Town to Berlin in January to keep my Silver Status made me realise, that none of my initial reasons to choose BA still exists, with the exception of the great cabin staff, that I feel really sorry for. The owners hired Álex Cruz last year, a very experienced low-cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: Turning BA into a low-cost carrier. Unfortunately. The result is a pity. No more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747's to Cape Town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. British Airways as a premium airline is lost. Realistically for year to come. Even with my status renewed, I don't think I will fly them again if I don't have to.

O Francis,"✅Verified Review| No, no, no, British Airways. You've messed up. Someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights, just like many other airlines do, and they said ""Let's provide food from M&S: that will make our offering classier than the rest."" The problem on my 18:55 flight from Marrakech to London was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink, so the service was inevitably snail-paced. A piece of friendly advice, BA, you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight, or you merely annoy your customers. Sitting near the back of the plane, my wife and I got served 2 hours into the 3.5 hour flight, by which time our tongues were hanging out. But what's this? Only two sandwiches left, and we bagged the last two packets of crisps. You're promising things you can't deliver, BA. There is such as thing as advertising standards, and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards. The 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively, even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someone's payment card failed to register on their machine. (Hint for frequent flyers: if your card just doesn't work you get your food and drink for free.) Meanwhile, behind the service trolley, a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves (a very appropriate expression in the circumstances). Other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and M&S extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight. Whoever at British Airways is employed to read reviews on this website, please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare. The process I call 'Ryanisation' of British Airways is almost complete. You now charge for checked baggage (yes, I know that's indirect, but only idiots can't see through the scam), you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall, and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats, and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' (what even BA used to call 'medium haul') flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane. Oh, and by the way: why don't the cabin crew deploy the A320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress? Too costly, perhaps?

J Egleton,"❎Unverified|  London Heathrow to Munich return. It used to be an enjoyable experience flying BA. Sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now, and travelling BA just feels like a bit of a chore. The loss of the free bar/food service on European flights is a real step down. Even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid-for M&S food on board. Oh, and how replacing my free drink with the same drink, only now I have to pay, is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me. Not even a free tea or bottle of water? (I asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying, only to find it tasted of chlorine - wouldn't recommend you do the same). The 'card-only' payment system is chaos as well, it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other. Next on the list is the outrageous prices that BA charge to select a seat in advance. Not wishing to pay this, by the time I checked in for this flight (the maximum 24 hours in advance) there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane I could choose from. I took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane, which is far from my first choice of seat. Other carriers let you select seats at check-in for free, and EasyJet charge about half of what BA charge to select the equivalent seats in advance (and if you pick one of the 'preferred' seats with EasyJet, you also get priority check-in and boarding for your money - not so with BA). Check-in at T5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check-in machine wouldn't work at all, and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldn't let me print a bag tag. So I couldn't use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check-in desks, wasting time. There was a minor delay due to fog, but that wasn't BA's fault and didn't have a hige impact. Flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good. On the way back, our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real 'pro' to flying BA in Europe with standard economy fares - the ability to switch between flights for free on-the-day. Could we? No, the earlier flight was full. Rather than sit in Munich airport all afternoon, we rebooked on Lufthansa instead. In summary, if flying BA on European routes these days, be aware that BA is now a no-frills carrier.

The flight from Heathrow to Gibraltar was uneventful, clean aircraft, no delays, no issues - apart from the lack of drinks / snacks. I'd love to know who thought this would be a good idea. Flying short haul, there is nothing to differentiate BA from easyJet or other no frills airlines. Add to this the lack of choice on their ""menu"". There are only a couple of sandwiches, and if you don't like mayo or cheese, you're out of luck. Well done BA, you've alienated loyal customers and are hardly likely to attract new ones. The flight from Heathrow to Belfast is my main gripe. The flight was meant to depart at 1645, but was delayed to 1720, hardly a big deal right? Wrong! The gate only went up at 1650, this led me to a bus which took us to the aircraft. It was 1730 before everyone was boarded, again, hardly a big deal except that we didn't take off until 1830, which meant that my dogs had to spend an extra night in kennels as I was back too late to pick them up. The flight itself was full, which wouldn't have been too bad if there hadn't been a lady sitting a couple of rows in front of me who stank. I won't go into details, but she smelled rancid. I was a few rows back and so didn't get the worst of it, but I could see others who were closer who were not having a good time at all. Needless to say I didn't enjoy the flight at all. I would go so far as to say that it's probably the worst flight I've been on, and I've flown Monarch and easyJet. I did e-mail BA with my concerns, but they didn't bother to reply.

They all seemed to be keen to get the service out of the way, dim the lights and disappear. Evidence of cost cutting in that water was only provided if asked for, any wine was by the glass, very cheap cutlery etc. BA is a premium airline but looks to be offering a Ryanair standard.

G Stainer,"✅Verified Review|  I was scheduled to fly BA208 from Miami to London on January 18th. Boarding and departure went normal, but than, close to take-off, the ordeal began. Captain announced a technical problem (at approx. 09:15 pm) and that's when the horror started. Overall, we ended up sitting in the plane until 01:00 am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane (any attempts to fix the fault failed). We were given accomodation, but that was a 45 mins drive from Miami Airport. Check-in took another 30 mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers, and the place was like a freezer. Was re-booked for a flight the next day, but downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy. Old, tatty 747, very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile phone. Worst of all, the delay of one day has forced me to add another night in London, and cancel my connection to Munich. Total additional expenses, not counting the difference between Premium Economy (which I paid for) and Economy was ~$500. Including the gap between Economy and Premium Economy probably ~$900. Now this is where a service oriented company would have an opportunity to make a difference. Submitted my compensation claims incl. proof for the above expenses, as per protocol online - no confirmation. Followed up with a call (had to wait approx. 45 mins to talk to a human) and was told that most expenses are not refundable but I would be compensated for the remaining. No further confirmation, email etc. Was paid a mere $50 into my account with no explanation what this is supposed to be for (the expenses were $900).

We had a bar service and meal, there was then nothing until breakfast (exactly the same as the Economy offering). This is appalling, British Airways has really gone downhill with its measly service offering.

London Heathrow to Edinburgh on British Airways domestic economy, check in at T5 okay although a little slow fast track security quick. I used the BA Galleries North lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon. Boarding through A8 on to a clean looking full A319. I had seat 25A which has no window. Crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on BA. Not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time baggage off quickly so flight not too bad. The footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards BA. In order to maintain my Executive club silver status (Oneworld Sapphire) I have to take 4 BA flights each year, which I can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so European and International flights I take each year will be either with other Oneworld carriers or others and not BA. The management at British Airways are making false claims, when suggesting ""it's what our passengers asked for"". I travelled with BA 16 times last year and I wasnt asked if I wanted a devaluation of the BA Executive Club - or was I asked if I wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats - I most certainly was never asked if I wanted the simple snack and a coffee on UK and European flights replaced by buy your own food - neither was I asked if I mind paying for snacks on International flights.

Mike Palmer,"✅Verified Review|  Toronto to Berlin via London on miles in a mix of classes. First class check in at Toronto was good with friendly staff. A fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins. Unfortunately first lounge was full (of gold card members) and so had to sit in the Biz lounge. Good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers. Fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2A. Excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew. A weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked. Good cheeses and all courses selected were available. After some decent sleep, a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight. T5 North lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty. Decent breakfast selection of hot rolls, fruit, cereals etc. Quick board for the flight to Berlin. Ridiculous leg room -at 30 inches max. Very cramped. Don't like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed. An ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions. On time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg. Returning to London in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever (including low cost airlines). A full A321 was cramped, insufficient bins (with one out of service) and the now infamous terrible leg room.(I understand this is to get even worse when BA moves to 180 pax on an A320 in line with charter and low cost carriers. Slow food and drink service with little take up. Some couldn't buy as no cash accepted. Not even juice, water and coffee offered for free. This penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the US and Canadian carriers look high class. The only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver. The whole plane looked fed up, subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish. Final leg to Toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand. Nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service. Poor lunch of roast chicken, weird mash and overcooked greens. Not Biz class food and pretty average. (more like economy food). Afternoon tea was fine, with a fast deplaning and bags. On the long haul legs, the IFE was identical to Christmas, poor choice, little new material - clearly even the IFE is now down graded. The biz class product - once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy. How the mighty have fallen! Experiencing four classes on four legs, showed the gulf in all classes between BA and competitors on both short and long haul. The short haul legs to / from Berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what you're getting and it's reflected in the fare and extras. With less leg room, fewer toilets, reduced quality and/or no refreshments, and a general downgrading of service, the only thing not reduced is the price. This suggests that the BA Exec and IAG only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline. The only thing left to strip customers of is the Exec Club and Avios. It's only a matter of time before this final nail in the BA coffin hits the customer at which point - I'm off!

L Irving,"✅Verified Review|  Flew London Heathrow to Gibraltar. This is probably the last time that I'll book a short haul with British Airways from Heathrow for anything other than a long holiday - no matter how cheap they make it they can't overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates, delays for take-off slots, long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport. Willie Walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports - slightly hollow laugh. BA are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers (in Economy) are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets. On our flight (of well over 2 hours) this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use. I have no objection to paying for food and drink but BA have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily. Seems like a structural flaw in their offering. The other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed - it took me back to the early days of EasyJet and Ryanair before allocated seating. So unless I'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows I think I'll use regional airports and the better general service (and available loos) that come with a single class cabin - no matter who the carrier is.",5.0,10.0,"""lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance""",2017-03-08,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Gibraltar,2017-02,no,London Heathrow , Gibraltar

On the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a KitKat! Cost cutting includes removing toilets.

L Rennie,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. This return journey was the worst long-haul flight that I've ever taken. British Airways Boeing 747-400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin, queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight. There was hardly any legroom and, while it's good that the seats recline quite a way, it's impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats. The seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep (I'm not a large lady, only 53kg!) and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally. I gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face I couldn't focus on it. The inflight meal was also very poor, unlike the food we had on five internal flights on SAA which was excellent.

Geoffrey Wyndham-Jones,"❎Unverified|  Oh dear: cost-cutting on British Airways has led to them becoming an embarrassment. Flew Kuwait to Edinburgh via London. Aircraft are still comfortable, timekeeping is good, and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming. However, most of the cabin crew were ""mature"", and the food and drink offering is now minimal. Breakfast from Kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables (no, not the omelette we used to have) plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla: both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby. ""Lunch"" was a mars bar or similar. I did not bother with the ""buy on board"" stuff on the flight to Edinburgh - I get a better choice in the terminal when I get off the aircraft. The domestic flight back from Edinburgh to Heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew I have ever seen on BA, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration - very unprofessional. The evening meal out of London back to Kuwait was more like a snack, with a smallish steak, three snap peas, three baby carrots (I counted the things), and another babyfood potato thing. ""Breakfast"" was a muesli bar. Sorry guys: a comment on this board that BA equals ""Budget Airline"" just about sums it all up. I have other choices from the Gulf back home, and next time I will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with BA is the extra legroom in Premium Economy, the choice of entertainment, and the direct flight to Heathrow rather than having to fly down the Gulf and return.

Clive Drake,"❎Unverified|  London Heathrow - Pisa return. I fly this route often as I have a house in Tuscany. I fly British Airways Club Europe only because the FAs are better, the lounge is a welcome benefit - and if you book far ahead enough - you can get a reasonable deal plus Avious points. That aside there is little benefits to flying say Ryanair. The trip started at T5 and the Northern lounge was not, for a change, to busy. Had a fruit and coffee breakfast. The options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps - dripping fat all over the place. Some years ago - BA provided some nice scrambled eggs. Now they don't. Flight left from the ""A"" terminal and we boarded ""downstairs"" from the lounge. The plane was half full. It was clean and valeted. We pushed back 10 minutes early. My wife had a sort of brunch thing, cheese and ham + rolls. She said it was ok. I had a couple of Gin and Tonics. The FA said she had never seen such an empty flight - and neither had I for that matter. The now chargeable food and beverages in Economy went down like a lead balloon apparently. I read the BA ""Brochure"" on the now chargeable food and as a Sales and Marketing professional - It was the most patronising piece of rubbish I'd ever read. It read as if BA were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all. And goodness me - the products are not cheap - over a £1 for a kit kat. We landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like Ryanair customers. Several years ago you had the air-bridge. Now you don't. The return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed. This in part is due to Qatar airlines operating out of Pisa and their Business Class customers use the same facility. Some booze and snacks - nothing edible. Flight delayed by 30 minutes. Plane was rammed. Very pleasant FAs. Afternoon tea - with horrible dried out sandwiches + scones that didn't look like scones. On both flights - the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table. No legroom. Hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as £600 return. Docked at the ""B"" terminal and had to walk miles to the trains - that took us back to T5/Terminal ""A"".

Due to a problem with our ticket which where first class returns to Heathrow, which I may add both my wife and I checked twice when booking the tickets was dated 12th March instead of 12th February. We checked in or tried to check in, whereupon the discrepancy was brought to our attention. We couldn't prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we still had to get home. The staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers, ""no nothing could be done"". We enquired the cost of two Economy seats home whereupon we told the two Economy tickets would come to an eye-watering $5092 or £4243 Economy. To add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be re-booked to the 12th February, no chance. We had no choice (over a barrel) scarcity value I hear you cry, no. We boarded to find that the flight was less than half full. My wife and I were beside ourselves with anger (not to the flight crew) it wasn't their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves.

M Gascoigne,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare and my experience was wonderful. There were a few problems checking in at Terminal 5 (there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check-in running slow - never mind these things happen). We were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best. Fast-track security was fast. Made my way to the lounge in South Terminal which was busy but I was able to find a quiet spot. Lots of food and drinks on offer but I stuck to water as I knew would be eating on the plane. Had to go to a gate in B terminal - this was my first time at Terminal 5 so asked how to get to the gate, very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train. Boarding was easy although I didn't use the priority boarding service (my bad missing the announcement). I paid extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper deck and really glad I did. Our cabin crew were wonderful, so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them. The food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice! I managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me. There's lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of 20 passengers so it feels very private. The window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in 62 or 64 A/K you have to climb over your neighbour's foot stool/legs to get in and out of your seat. 63J is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it's by an exit door (ideal for anybody over 6ft). There is a long not too high drawer to place items (I put a pair of knee-length leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more) and there's the overhead lockers.

Nicola Beretta,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Mumbai. I've been a loyal BA customer for several years, but this was a journey of disappointment. I was late to the airport due to delays on the train line. Called customer services while on my way, and after 15min of wait I was told they couldn't do anything about it, but gave me the number of the airport. It was incorrect. At Terminal 5 I asked the attendant for help given the rush. He was quite rude and said I had to join the queue unless I was flying business. At the gate, we had a late boarding because 'the computer wasn't working'. I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlines.  Plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment. My headrest was hanging down the seat, the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldn't stay in position. The flight attendant (who I never saw smiling for the entire flight) said he had reported it on the way in. I asked to change my seat. In my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops (it wasn't the headphones, I tried mine too). The entertainment system was poor. It started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing, plus the 'noise cancelling' headphones are NOT noise cancelling - try pulling the jack out and it doesn't make a difference. Overall a very poor experience, crowned by a terrible breakfast.

The next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refused. I argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights. After about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together. I later found out the two BA employees, travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually, after a great deal of argument moved. I have complained to BA and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesn't in the future. Next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight. My IFE didnt work, they offered to move me, ironically to swap with one of the BA employees but I declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife. Choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal. Dreadful, stressful experience for people who'd paid a lot of money. Have been called by Customer Service who have offered us 10000 Avios as compensation, enough for a night at the Holiday Inn Express! Awful company to deal with, totally dismissive of customer need.

J Laws,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Miami. I paid £50 extra for an exit seat - this is the best thing to do. Make sure you get the one closest to window, mainly because no-one stands there to stretch their legs etc. You get unlimited leg room and the ability to stand up and wander / stretch whenever you want, and it is good value on a ten hour flight. The seats on the A380 are narrow, the entertainment system the usual etc. The meals were fine. My major issue with British Airways economy is their penny pinching. You sit down, there is no welcome snack - you then have your meal and  seven hours later if you are hungry, you have to pay for basic snacks. It's ridiculous. On American Airlines they put out boxes of pretzels, biscuits etc which you can just help yourself to. If you have a diet coke, on American you get a full 330ml can, on British Airways you get the small version.

C Christodolou,"✅Verified Review|  Lisbon to London Heathrow. Now that BA have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. Over the last few years, leg room across European flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline. That said, it is in practice worse than budget airlines, because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button, eliminating further discomfort. Even without the seat in front reclined, anyone taller than 5' 8"" will be packed in tightly on any European short-haul flight. The staff are friendly and polite. However, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins. This does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers, but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets. Business class (which I sometimes use) is offered a free meal and drinks, all of a reasonable quality. However, in terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared to economy. The only reason I continue to fly BA is because I have fairly set routes and BA generally fly at times which suit me. Otherwise, I get little in the way of added value. The benefits of Avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it (in monetary terms), particularly if one mostly flies within Europe. It is much cheaper to get a lounge membership (many are valid for most European - and beyond - airports), rather than remain loyal to BA these days. I have been flying with BA for well over a decade now, on a monthly basis. My sympathies go to the staff, because I fear cost-cutting will get them next, which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day.",2.0,10.0,"""rebrand to a budget airline""",2017-02-24,A320,Business,Economy Class,Lisbon to London,2017-02,no,Lisbon , London

I decided to give British Airways a chance for a short weekend trip to London, because when it comes to prices they cannot beat the low-cost airlines. And what do you know? I had a part of the low-cost experience paying a bigger price: no checked-in luggage included (not even as a oneworld Emerald) and you had to pay for your inflight snacks and beverages. A plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good. The prices were even below airport ones. The bad thing was indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the products (people were buying stuff) and it took ages until you could get your order - well, you can't compete with Ryanair trying to do better the things they do best. I really miss the days when British Airways was offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack, it was a pleasure to fly with them and I would be happy to get back to those days. Some good things about the flights was that they landed ahead of schedule, boarding was very efficient, which is a big plus and the seats were gorgeous, a lot of space, very comfortable leather seats.

Mike Palmer,"✅Verified Review|  Toronto to London in premium economy. Easy check in and fast track security meant I was in the lounge within 15 mins. Unfortunately, they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flight. Poor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on it's last legs. I let the front desk know, and the staff made me a fresh sandwich. Also, beers had changed with 5 lagers and Newcastle Brown. The Manager fetched some IPA from the first lounge - some really good customer service which is typical in this lounge. The most disorganised boarding ever with few PAs. Onboard, juice or water offered. I asked for sparking wine but it's only done on flights from London - (crew explained it can't be chilled at outstations - (poor excuse given they do it for Club and First). Fast service after take off with an ok entree. Poor salad, and a nasty dry piece of cake. IFE was the same as my trip over Christmas so it seems the IFE is updated less often. Tea, coffee and juice offered before landing. But no muffin or even a biscuit - really poor. Prompt disembarking and bags beat me to the baggage belt. Return a week later was a better flight. Easy check in again and no fast track queue. North Lounge was an average experience, ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh. Bused to aircraft, a Boeing 787-9, with premium economy only half full. A half glass of prosecco was offered and a requested top up was forgotten. Fast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service. An ok meal with a rancid coleslaw, ok steak and a tiny pot of desert. Generous with the drinks. Unfortunately, the dropping of afternoon tea at the back is inexplicable and really poor judgement by BA. I was offered T&Cs plus a breakfast bar or malt loaf finger. The crew were genuinely embarrassed (a couple of sandwiches I liberated from the club lounge made up for it). Fast off the plane, and despite slow immigration, the bags beat me again. Overall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitors. The meal is nowhere near Club standard and its the cutting of the small things - nibbles, breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most. Be competitive but don't take it out on me! I wouldn't mind but the prices don't go down with the reduction of service. Despite what the CEO maintains - it is not in response to customer feedback.

Peter Hill,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Stuttgart. Fly in comfort and style is the slogan of British Airways, but there is not much of either around these days. Not willing to pay an extra £8, I was allocated a middle seat right at the rear. At the gate an announcement was made for volunteers to check in their hand-luggage ""at no extra cost"". Within a minute a burly employee told me I had to check in my cabin bag, saying ""you should not believe what is said on the company's website"". How very true! Some ten other passengers, equally perplexed suffered the same fate. I know there were ten, because another employee kept counting us and saying ""we need ten"". The burly employee was later to be found on the airbridge to make sure that we really did hand over our cabin bags. All in all a demeaning experience. The seat rows are now more tightly packed than before. Although of average slim build, I found the seat a tight fit. Only a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink (the deceptive ""upgrade"" we were sold at the beginning of the year). But still, did not reach the back of the plane until shortly before landing. Not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared, but also newspapers and priority boarding for those of us who are frequent flyers. On the return journey I noticed part of the reason for this new policy: the Stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff.

Michael Davies,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Rome return. Race to the bottom. My first time with the new buy onboard service. I was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment. Basically it does not work. I can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options. I would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks. Even soft drinks are chargeable - I don't think this is acceptable. However, despite the extensive menu, there was an extremely limited selection available. One crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food. There was a 20-25 minute wait time for this. The crew then came around with the drinks trolley. This was extremely slow. The payments could only be made with credit cards or Avios points. The payment added significant times to process. Despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin, we didn't get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started. There was only the one trolley, and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent. CEO Alex Cruz and British Airways - your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom - more rows in economy, 10 abreast in some 777's and other cost cutting measures mean that even though I'm a Silver Exec club member I am now considering my future travel options.

A Galyan,"✅Verified Review|  Edinburgh to London City. Despite having a confirmed booking, when I attempted to check-in with a prepaid-for bag at 1535 at the EDI airport for a 1655 flight to LCY (domestic flight) I was told I couldn’t as the flight had been oversold. I accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with Flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldn’t be authorised so I had to ‘wait’. I then stood around for 10 minutes, being asked to ‘move out of the way’ at one point because I was blocking others. I was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details (despite what the BA website claims should be done) and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves. I was simply ignored until I approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor. None was available nor could be contacted, apparently. I wasn’t allowed to transfer to the Flybe flight “in case” a seat became available on my original flight, so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in. I was told to wait for another 20 minutes. I argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given I had a confirmed booking in the first place but I was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and it’s not their problem that other people had checked-in before me. I was treated as a nuisance. At one point, there were 5 members of BA check in staff doing nothing (nobody else to serve) whilst I was just standing silently there ‘waiting’ and being ignored. After 20 minutes of not knowing what to do, my original flight closed and I was approached by a supervisor (who suddenly was available to talk to me) and given a seat. I asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier I had been told the flight was already full with no seats available. He explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in, and as the check-in was closing, they could give me the seat now. I informed him that I resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier (though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous) and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings. I had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily, like a problem rather than a customer. I then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure I was not denied boarding at the gate for being late (even though I had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally, especially for a domestic flight). As I told the supervisor, if the airline treats its customers with such contempt, do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt. Under their current policy of overbooking, passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all, even though they have a confirmed booking.

M Kemp,"✅Verified Review|  This a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to Business Class passengers. We were flying to Mauritius on holiday and I felt, given the flying time, we should spoil ourselves and fly up-front with all the 'comparative' comfort of Business Class. The British Airways flight itself was okay, the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine. However, I was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the Gatwick Lounge (a small issue for some perhaps, but for me, it's all part of the Business Class experience). To illustrate my point, I attach a shot of what Walsh's policy of putting shareholders first actually means for fare-paying passengers. With the very confusing layout that greets one in the South Terminal now that BA have moved in, the 'serve yourself' check-in (you even label your own bags!). I was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the 'Lounge'. But then to be greeted with this, was totally unacceptable. So, Willie, rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders, this sort of display of overt cost-cutting has now lost you revenue for the future. Short-sighted management or what? Take a lesson from Emirates who I decided to fly home with, so disgusted was I over our experience.

Plenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner I'd flown on. I was given an exit row seat which was very welcome. BA usually charge £58 for this seat. It meant about 5 foot of legroom and because the next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the entire flight meaning the area was very quiet.

That was the only good part of our journey. We boarded a packed old 767 which was decaying with the middle seat (E) so narrow it was impossible to get in and out of the seat in flight. (We were in row 13). Without notice, we had to go through de-icing which meant a 45min delay to our service (we did however catch up 35mins). Our inbound flight was on a newer A319 which had better seats and a skymap. Due to slot restrictions at Rome and London, this flight was also delayed. During both flights the new buy on board was poorly done, taking forever with a limited range of overpriced products.

After 5 hours I rang the bell. The female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously, ""did you ring the bell""? Yes, once, the entire flight. I asked for the sandwich and she told me that I would have to wait. No, I want it now. Not a five course meal, a sandwich. Having just flown on Qatar Airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time, apparently a pre-prepared sandwich was a big ask. In business class.

Mike Bailey,"✅Verified Review|  Heathrow to Hong Kong in Business Class on 3rd January as part of a holiday to New Zealand, also involving flights with Cathay Pacific and Malaysia Airlines. The flight to Hong Kong with British Airways showed up all that is bad about British Airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines. The continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight. Check-in at Terminal 5 was chaotic, there having been a ""computer glitch"" which greatly slowed the check-in and bag drop processes. There were too few BA staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed. Business check-in was better but still very busy. BA needs to speed up bag drop urgently. Other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy, not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily. The lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture, used dishes not being cleared, too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability. Not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and I would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards. Compare this to the other ""home"" lounges of other carriers such as those at Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. Took a shower whilst waiting and that was OK. The flight was not good at all. Cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing. Gone are all the small (and not so small) touches that made flying with BA a pleasure, such as hanging up coats, hot towels, a second round of drinks, a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after. A comment about the seats, how can BA justify 8 across in Business Class? When the ying/yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution, but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you don't have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping. I had a window seat and I felt very hemmed in. There was no storage space for the things you need during a flight, glasses, tablet computer, water bottle etc. All were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat. Sadly BA is no longer my airline of choice. I spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the Union Flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home. I saved a considerable number of Avios points for my retirement which I am now using up, but on other airlines within the One World Alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted. Sorry BA but you've lost my loyalty. Club World is now very poor (and also Club Europe now) and you've lost the plot to the bean counters.

Seats the same as anyone else and they insist on putting these silly yellow cabin bag bands on carry on bags like they mean anything. I checked a bag so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that I immediately ripped off.

P Eden,"✅Verified Review|  How the mighty have fallen, or should I say continue to fall. My partner and I booked tickets from London to Johannesburg back in September 16, we paid approx £1700 for the 2 economy tickets (slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats). It was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new A380, our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats, so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft - not life threatening, just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag, we were surprised about the lack of space. Our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced ""here is your vegetable lasagne"" rather than explaining that for our £1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal (chicken or beef) as they had ran out of these! They made no effort to remedy the situation, whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know, all I can say is that I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasn't happy with a vegetable lasagne so I had no meal as a result. As I left the aircraft I received a text from BA asking for feedback on the flight, I took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response. Whilst I was in Johannesburg I tried to contact/ call Johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at BA is like trying to get an audience with Pope Francis! I eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didn't qualify for any redress, I then challenged this, I explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1) would I have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight (no!) and 2) would BA if they were reasonable, expect me to pay the full cost. In summary, I eventually was offered £15 credit off my next BA flight - totally unacceptable as I don't fly that often, even £15 shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient, I felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it's onboard service and the same for it's customer relations which arrogantly doesn't give a damn.

I was seated 9 rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off. Before landing I spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served ... they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them. This was not a cheap fare that I got, and British Airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service, buy onboard etc. What a lie, I have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before BA stopped any complimentary service.

They were miles ahead of budget airlines. Yes they were a bit more expensive, but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage, checked in cases of 20kg, all part of the service. Today BA provides no free food or beverage, and require extra payment for check in luggage. Today, within Europe, BA has absolutely no advantage opposite EasyJet, Norwegian, Monarch or even Ryanair. Why should anyone pay extra for BA, they have lost absolutely their unique selling points. Incidentally coming back from Malta to London Gatwick in BA in business class, there is nowhere to hang coats. Previously BA flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard. And now NO CUPBOARDS!

P Garvey,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Cape Town return. Having previously flown BA First Class on the Boeing 777 and A380, this trip on an ageing Boeing 747-400 from Heathrow Terminal 3 was disappointing. The sooner BA replace these aircraft, the better. I had a window seat which at least was not as cramped as the middle seats, which looked more like BA's dreadful Club World seats. The first disappointment came after pre-booking meals only to be told that due to the cabin crew strike which had ended the day before we were flying, we would get a Club World meal instead. Why? There are only 14 First Class seats and the caterers were not on strike so quite annoyed to be offered a few AVIOS as compensation! The IFE screen quality was poor and the movie selection not particularly good. The good thing was that we had 2 excellent ladies serving in our cabin. BA need to stop treating their premium passengers with contempt and wake up to the fact there is a lot of competition. Priority boarding is a joke; anybody with a Bronze Executive club card gets that so half the aircraft rush to the boarding gate. Priorities need re-assessing (and controlling).

J Hicklin,"✅Verified Review|  San Francisco to Johannesburg via London. The two flights were as different as night and day. Both night flights so the idea was to get as much sleep as possible. SFO-LHR BA286 19th January was a full Business Class cabin but amazing service by mature flight attendants. Perfect mix of professionalism, friendliness and efficiency although the Boeing 747 had seen better days. They had the main meal service done and dusted within two hours allowing for plenty of sleep. LHR-JNB, BA055 on 20th January was an absolute disgrace. Great aircraft but let down by shambolic and rude in flight service. These attendants were much younger and besides looking sullen and miserable the main meal service took 4 hours - this on a night flight. Post take off drinks were served relatively quickly. There was then a massive gap between that and the meal order being taken. And a further huge gap between the meal service being started. All the while being delivered by the most miserable steward I've ever had the displeasure to encounter. Being a Gold card holder the CSM (who was a delight) came to give me her 'personal welcome' and I did feedback about my experience. She acknowledged that these new crews are 'inexperienced' and I said that's no excuse for rudeness. Why can BA not mix the old and new crew together if the newbies cannot get to grips with a basic efficient service? Later had the pleasure of flying JNB-CPT on Comair (a BA franchise in South Africa). What a great little airline. Again very young crew but an absolute delight.

The business class lounge facilities were not available due to move to south terminal. We had to use the general lounge that any passenger prepared to pay £37.50 could use. This meant it was overcrowded and dirty (through no fault of the regular staff. They just could not keep up with the number of passengers). We could not get a seat anywhere and when we advised BA staff of this we were told to come back later and see if there were any seats free. The BA ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits end. The flight was mediocre to say the least. The food was average and the service satisfactory. Having paid £2000 for a ticket it is not unreasonable to expect a good service. We formally complained to British Airways via their customer services department and the response came back as they were moving to the south terminal and we needed to be understanding as things would get better in the future! We were not even offered a refund on the tea we bought in the main area of the terminal as we could not get into the lounge they had provided.

P Simpson,"✅Verified Review| In September 2016, I flew with British Airways in First from London to Kuala Lumpur on flight BA0033. Initial impressions were positive. The check-in was efficient with polite and friendly staff. The Concorde Room was a nice place to be. My First suite (2A) offered a good amount of comfort, space and privacy. Fast forward 12+ hours. Would I fly in British Airways First again? No. Would I fly with British Airways again? No. This is why: On the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the First cabin, with 8 passengers. The 1st cabin crew member was polite and professional. The 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional. The supplied headphone set was faulty and did not work. I had to ask twice for a replacement set. It took over 40 minutes to receive this. Once airborne, I ordered a cappuccino. I had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arrive. There were multiple issues with my dinner: - I was the second person to order my dinner; yet the last person to be served. It took over 2 hours to get my dinner. Someone who had ordered after me, got my dinner option (I was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only one option was available). It would appear that this passenger had a higher Executive Club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course. I was only given the option of a Club World main course (which was delayed further as I was initially given the wrong order). This delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and I was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew member. There were issues with my breakfast: Despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast, another passenger was served first and given my breakfast. I ordered a Cappuccino; the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order. When I enquired again (some 40 minutes after I had placed my order) I was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore I could not have this. I was extremely disappointed as at the material time I placed my order (and for some time after this) there had been no seat belt sign displayed. The First cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight. Formal Complaint Within 24 hours of landing in KUL, I wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the CEO of British Airways, Alex Cruz. The ‘You First’ department at British Airways confirmed receipt of my email. Subsequently, I received a very generic response from British Airways Customer Relations. No attempt was made to address (or even explore) the issues that gave rise to my complaint. This was disappointing. I was simply offered 10,000 Avios points. I responded by return, rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why I had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by British Airways to address the issues that I had outlined in my formal complaint. The response from British Airways Customer Relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10,000 Avios points was because British Airways “have to be consistent so we’re fair to all our customers”.

Rosemary Hill,"✅Verified Review|  London to Hong Kong return. Through no fault of our own, very late-running bus, major road accident, and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for the next bus – my friend and I missed our 18.30 flight to Hong Kong on December 12th. We thought we would be re-booked on the later 20.50 flight, especially since we had business class tickets. Instead, we were told by the BA official at the misnamed ‘Customer Services’ desk that we had ‘voluntarily’ missed our plane (I assume that was code for ‘it’s your fault, not our problem’; that was certainly what his attitude conveyed). We were then offered 3 options – pay a supplement of £1478 to take the 20.50 flight, take a downgrade to Premium Economy WITHOUT a guarantee that BA would reimburse us the difference in seat price, or wait four days. The BA official couldn’t have been less flexible or sympathetic, and BA has responded to my complaint via Twitter with the same disinterest. My travel companion’s business class seat was a gift for her 60th birthday. Any pleasure she might have got from it, and mine in giving it to her, were ruined by the way we were treated. On the (half-empty) flight back on New Year’s Eve the crew obviously didn’t want to be there, was barely courteous, and when my friend, a diabetic, enquired what would be in her special meal, she was told no-one knew. They clearly didn’t care, either. They did very grudgingly eventually agree that she could order from the regular menu after making it clear that this was an exception and a ‘privilege’ she was being granted. I would have thought, and expected, a little more courtesy and grace, especially in Business Class. God knows how the poor souls in the back were treated. I have given my preference to BA for years in order to support my home airline. Sadly, I don’t think they deserve my custom any longer, so the next time we fly to Asia we will take one of the Gulf airlines who at least give the impression that they want and value your custom. BA’s only concern these days is profit at any price; their customer service is as poor as any I’ve ever come across, and their corporate motto ‘To Fly To Serve’ an embarrassing joke.

P Brown,"✅Verified Review|  Miami to London Business Class. Living in London, and flying international long haul flights throughout the year I have once again been disappointed by British Airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabins. Our family of four were travelling home from the Christmas holidays on an overnight flight and when I was ready to sleep I attempted to recline my seat in the ""flat bed position"". My seat would not recline. The flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to. These are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft. I notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it. Sadly, he did not. I was informed that the head/purser was on his crew rest and that he would come discuss the situation with me in an hour and a half. Hopefully his accommodations were better than mine. Prior to landing (20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight), the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of BA and said he could compensate me with either £50 or 10,000 Avios. I informed him there was a far greater price point between Premium Economy vs. Business Class. Understandably, he apologised and said that was all he was capable of doing. I received a call from a BA representative and I was informed that she could only provide me with similar compensation - £50 or 10,000 Avios. (I currently have 588,500 avois on BA that is nearly impossible to use). I requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from Heathrow to Atlanta from a Premium Economy seat to a Business Class seat. The BA representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the Business Class experience - the food, individual flight attendant service and comfort. Sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a Business Class seat - not the food. My comfort was not met. The flight attendants on BA have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin, the point was to sleep.",2.0,10.0,"""have once again been disappointed by British Airways""",2017-01-05,Boeing 747,Family Leisure,Business Class,MIA to LHR,2017-01,no,MIA , LHR

Mike Palmer,"✅Verified Review|  Toronto to London return in Club World on 787-900 with British Airways. Outbound was upgraded a couple of months ago from World Traveller Plus (worth the money for a decent night's sleep). Fast check in and fast track security at Pearson meant I was in the lounge within 15 mins. Excellent lounge supper service with a choice of a roast or noodles in soup. The lounge is well managed and maintained with friendly staff and a well stocked bar. On time boarding but a delayed departure due to loading baggage. A glass of champagne, with a top up, before departure. I always find boarding in Club World disjointed and fragmented as crew from World Traveler assist making the pre departure service erratic. A fast drinks service and supper were served with lights out. A well timed late breakfast meant a decent 5 hours sleep on this leg and my food choices were actually available. Priority bags beat me to the baggage belt. The return leg was enhanced due to being upgraded 24 hours before departure. (clearly oversold for such early action but welcome as a BA Silver member). The flight was one of my best business class flights and reminded me of the old BA I knew and loved. Fast bar service done by tray and not by cart, an excellent meal of roast chicken, with a delicious caramel desert (plated too) and some decent wines. The only reduction in service spotted this time was the wine list was down to two reds, two whites and no Rose. That said, the wines were very good. The cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional, friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when asked. Afternoon tea is a now a bit of let down with the scones dropped. An early landing, and prompt bags on the belt completed a stellar trip back home.

B Davidson,"✅Verified Review|  Having read so many negative reviews on this site regarding British Airways and their First Class product I was somewhat concerned as to what the experience would be like on our First Class flight from LHR-SAN on BA273 on their B747-400, I needn't have worried, this flight was excellent on all aspects. Our domestic connecting flight from MAN-LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to fog at LHR, the Captain  came into the Gate area and explained the reasons of the delay and invited questions from any concerned passengers about their connecting flights in LHR. Luckily we had planned 4 hours into our itinerary so the delay caused us no problems, passengers with tight connections at LHR were offered alternative connection options. The Concorde Lounge in LHR T5 BA First Class passengers was superb with professional and courteous staff, we had booked a Cabana and Spa Treatments, both were superb and highly recommended, plan time into your itinerary to enjoy these to the full. The lounge offers A la Carte Dining and the food was excellentpromptly, Champagne and great wines were also available. Onboard the BA747 in the First Cabin we had seats 2A & 2K, these offered great comfort for the 11 hour flight, the seats were made into a bed by the cabin crew when you requested it, I got 6 hours sleep, good quality quilts and pillows helped this. Seats 1A or 1K may have been slightly better for a couple travelling together as they are closer together than 2A 2K, but this is not a negative issue. The meal service was excellent, dine when you want, excellent choice of aperitifs, wines and champagne. The young Cabin Crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner throughout the 11 hour flight. First Class seats offer good privacy, probably centre seats 4EF and 5EF offer the least privacy and therefore I would avoid these where possible.

Once on board the aircraft we departed quickly.The seats was pretty old but just about comfortable enough. Once in the air immigration cards are handed out followed by a drink service, but no pretzels like BA used to do. About 2 hours after take off food was served. (chicken curry or vegetable lasagna). Lunch was quite nice, but small. After lunch duty free was sold. Four hours into the flight the cabin lights were turned off. The IFE was OK, there were lots of movies and tv shows, but not many games. Also the screen went fuzzy when the moving map was on. Screen was small but touch screen still worked. Between meals there were snacks available, but they had to be paid for (there used to be a free snack box). Drinks were also avaliable and free between meals. An hour before a sandwich, kitkat and a drink were served, the size was not adequate, but tasted nice. After the service was cleared plane stared the long descent into Tampa airport.

So for the insult of paying for reasonable seats, my wife and I were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft - no refund, just shoulder shrugs about it being a different aircraft. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to Venice, thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at Heathrow. Overall a loss of a half day. Thinking that BA would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights, was wasted. A couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided. A suggestion that access to the British Airways lounge would be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment.

John H Griffiths,"Bangkok to Manchester via London. I used to fly BA on this route on a regular basis 10 years ago and was impressed with the whole offering. More recently we've been using Emirates or Etihad. We travel the route two or three times a year to visit family. BA were offering a good price on their Premium Economy seats so we switched. What a big mistake. Never, ever again. Despite paying a premium price you can only book your seat within 24 hours of departure unless you pay a £40 - £50 surcharge. Reluctant to pay we had some anxious moments worrying whether we would sit together. In the end it was OK but we can't get over the cheek of charging to book a seat - Emirates and Etihad don't charge. The seats themselves were very old and uncomfortable. Leg room was OK but the seats were very narrow. Nothing like the comfort of Emirates or Etihad in Economy. Inflight entertainment was on a post card size screen with a touch screen that was very inconsistent. Picture quality was like watching a TV in the 1950's. Food was appalling. Little choice, insipid starters and mains swimming in water. Other than an initial drinks run and obviously the food service the rest of cabin service was nil! If you want extra drinks or service including water the only recourse was to visit the galley at the back of the plane. Cabin crew were surly and generally unhelpful. The plane was old and the cabins were tired and threadbare in places.

Clive Drake,"The return flight from St Lucia started well. To my surprise the Business Class lounge for 1st and Club customers at the airport was a pleasant shared lounge and the British Airways flight was the only one leaving at this hour. It was very nice - considerably better than the dive at Antigua. It was light and airy, very comfortable seats and some decent snacks and a well equipped bar. We enjoyed our stay there. It was some trek to the plane. As I entered the front forward door and made my way to seat 1A a lady FA almost grabbed me and snatched at my boarding pass - ""we have to see it,"" she said sharply, ""its a security process."" I was startled at the aggressive tone as if I was trying to sneak on the plane. Very strange as I had passed three boarding pass checks anyway. Pre flight drinks was the usual lukewarm champagne. Plane left on time to the minute. There were five empty seats in 1st. I found my miserable looking, ever thinning pillow (they get smaller with every flight to save money) and went looking to sneakily find another. Can you believe this! Five empty seats. Four empty overhead bins. One remaining pillow in the fifth bin! (Which I grabbed). Even with two - on lie flat I had hardly any head support. My wife asked for a 2nd pillow. ""Sorry madam we have none to spare."" Dinner started with Quinoa Salad and smoked trout. It was alright. Cream of broccoli soup likewise alright. Balsamic honey glazed chicken for mains was a disaster. Dried out. Unedible. FAs made up my bed. It was hard as rock and very uncomfortable. I slept not for one minute. Nor did my wife. Nor did the lady in the adjacent seat. I flew the A380 in 1st, last spring to Singapore and slept for 5 hours - but it was far more softer to sleep on. I can only surmise the seat, about five years old - was worn out. (The side areas were also very grubby). We both embarked totally shattered. The plane generally was very tired. Worn carpets that really should be replaced. The usual cheap amenities bag rounded off the usual poor experience with BA 1st Class. The IFE was very dated. One wonders if the BA board every think of flying with an Asian or Middle Eastern carrier to discover what true 1st Class should look like. FAs - apart from the rude one - were great.

Simon Channon,"✅Verified Review|  Flew Club World from Chengdu to London last week, my first time on BA long haul for a few years. How they manage to retain their reputation is a complete mystery, with the onboard product being simply awful - and this on a newer Boeing 787 plane! The cabin was tatty - tables loose, problems with seat recline mechanism, IFE clunky and slow. The food was not even to economy standards, and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful money saving. Amenity kit second rate, the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish, and whilst the flight was quite empty in business, the service seemed to be on a go-slow. Staff (when they appeared in the cabin) were quite friendly, but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the poor facilities that BA now provide.

No real complaints as the seats in business class are private and comfortable for sleeping although the meal quality left a little to be desired.

Clive Drake,"Flight from LGW to St Lucia got off to a puzzling start at check in. No priority tags available and I had to ask for them. (I need not have bothered as the bags came off the plane last anyway). The BA 1st Class lounge was ""still closed"" pending refurbishment. (I do not think BA have any intention of re-opening the lounge at LGW.) The No ""1"" alternative is okay. Boarded and shown to seat. Noted floors had not been hoovered from the inbound flight. All scruffy. Flight took off on time to the minute. FAs throughout were fine - but no personal address by name. Seats look a little ""old"" - I suspect this plane was one of the first to have the ""new"" 1st Class. The IFE was certainly dated. Meal was ""sort of okay."" No ""Amuse Bouche"" anymore as BA want to cut further costs. Had to settle for some motley peanuts. They soon run out of the premium champagne - I suspect they only had two bottles on board. Crab appetizer was alright - nothing special. The usual butternut squash soup. This was my 5th 1st Class flight this year and my 5th identical soup. I suppose its too much to expect a nice clam chowder or lobster bisque from the bean counters at BA HQ. Main course of sole was dry and tasteless. Wines were fine and for once nicely chilled. Another disappointing experience from BA - but to be honest over time you get used to a ""business class"" product in BA 1st Class. I noted, when I selected my seats, that there was two unsold seats four days before the flight and a one way price was a staggering £4500. The flight was full - and if I paid £4500 for this - I would be in despair. I was asked recently why fly BA 1st Class at all. Its down to cubic meters of space. - and that's it.

Kathleen Kirby,"✅Verified Review| British Airways crew going out from London Heathrow to Calgary were very keen and enthusiastic. They were also very good fun, which makes life more pleasant up in the sky. We do this flight every 6 months on our way to visit family in Canada. Food was good, but like other reviewers we've noticed little changes which make things not quite so special. For instance, the wine is not as pleasant as it used to be, and there used to be a choice of 2 types of red or white. One of our fellow passengers said he could have done with a bit more food. So take some snacks with you for the wee small hours. On the return journey, the dinner was good, but they ran out of beef in premium economy, and there were only 6 of us. We were given food from business, but it was served on a freezing cold plate, and just lacked finesse. I know this is only premium economy, but there were good standards a few years back. The breakfast before landing at Heathrow was horrible, a bagel, with some cream cheese in it and some tooth breaking cereal bars. I must write and complain to BA about their breakfasts, and have done so once, with no effect. I will try again.

Thai Airways or Eva Air for the same price offer a much better service (for direct flights). If you want the best go with Emirates but it's a stop over flight. I fly this route 20 times a year.

From my experience I believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flying. The aircraft are very old. If you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you 'Can you wait? service is in 20 mins' this has been tested a few times. They hate anyone who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customers. The next service could be in 1 hour but they will still tell you 20 mins.

Food for a shorthaul flight was very good and drinks including champagne regularly offered. The only gripe I have is that unless you are a One World Emerald card holder you can't select your seat at the time of booking unless you pay £22 per person per sector. I think it's a British Airways thing. Even the LCCs let you book your seat for a reasonable cost. Paying business class prices I expect to get seat selection as a standard regardless of my status.

P Mercer,"Check-in at Singapore Airport is carried out in a separate area away from the desks and it was done quickly, efficiently and enables you to bypass the queue to enter the terminal. Boarding was chaotic. After announcing families with children, first and club passengers, and cardholders, the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance. As before, the cabin crew were professional, helpful and enthusiastic. Dinner was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening flight. It seems a shame that in its desire to cut costs, British Airways uses tablecloths and napkins which seem a little too thin and the cutlery is slightly too small. Nevertheless, the food was tasty and cooked properly and there was a good selection of wine and spirits. After a couple of glasses of port they made my bed and I slept soundly for several hours. The seat is equipped with two USB ports but these put out such little power by iPhone took a long time to charge and they could not handle an iPad. We landed at Heathrow on time and reached Terminal 5 within a matter of minutes. One of British Airways’ greatest assets is its cabin crew who, in my experience, are considerably better than their rivals.

Joe Kaiser,"✅Verified Review| London Heathrow to San Francisco with British Airways. BA was once a classy airline for their first class service, amenities and food. But they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points. They even hijack you for an additional $1000. Or as I like to say, you cough up 200K in points and the $1000 fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first. They have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers. The seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a 6'1"", 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu. Second, the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times I flew BA in first I had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving FC customers. A request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience. The last trip flying home in April I was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu. First class was maybe 50% full. When it was my turn, I asked the flight attendant if I could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu - she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items. Now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport? Clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies. At the average price of $10,000 for a first class seat, BA should make damn sure first class has all the food you need. Their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two BA first class flights to the US when I wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class. The food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of US airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated. Way to go BA, you have sunk to the lowest common denominator. Third, when I arrive in SF and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag, it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count. Unlike the first class asian carriers like Singapore and Cathay where my FC luggage arrives first, BA is always hit and mostly miss. Finally, what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my FC experience on BA. I let them know everything I said in this review and the last question asked is ""would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience""? Yes, I say and not once has someone called.

J Caws,"✅Verified Review|  First leg DUS to LHR was Club Europe. While business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke. It was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight. Crumbs on the seat. Table was sticky. Asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning. Overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly. Next leg from LHR to BOS very similar experience: Business class was upgraded with an outstanding new IFE but seats are still old. The housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool. Asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape. In general the 747-400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the IFE and some smaller details (e.g. carpet should be replaced - extremely dirty and roved). Lounge in LHR very outdated. Boarding in LHR was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people don't listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons. Crew on board once again very friendly and effective. Meal choice was ok. But my impression is that quality is going down, e.g. beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked. Club Kitchen -> long time an outstanding feature of BA is a joke nowadays. Selection seems to go down every time I fly. Worst of all: One of my bags did not made it to the aircraft. This itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke. After identifying that my bag seems to be lost I went to the counter (even if finding it is not that easy in Boston). I explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that I did not checked another bag -> although I had my tag that I could show to her. I had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written. Manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help. No apologies for inconvience at all. Last year I had one bag that was delayed. This handling was done by another person and was completely different experience. Extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience. Summarizing: Flying BA for business for many years and on a regular basis now. The changes under the new boss can be seen. While in the past British Airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month. This time flight was one of the worst I ever had with BA. I assume that if there is no change in the near term I will choose another airline in future e.g. a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more.

B Pearson,"✅Verified Review|  I booked and bought an online ticket for a multi destination 6 week trip that took me from Bangkok to London, Angola, London, Nigeria, London and back to Bangkok. Before purchase I called the British Airways service number on website and asked if I needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that OK - was told 'yes but have to pay a £150 fee', and nothing else a little steep but OK. I further checked extra's would be against the Visa card used to purchase the ticket, 'of course' was the reply. BA make you pay to book a specific seat now. The trip started okay but the aircraft used on the Bangkok flight very worn and old - anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting Nigeria for 12 days business and looked like I could arrange to come home earlier - fired up the BA app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to re-book on the APP as indicated - not given any local number to call - search out possible BA numbers - to find they no longer have an office in Nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in India. Operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has to check the additional cost to come up with an extra of £1000+. I decline this option and explain the £150 as advised (actually APP says change cost is £0). Later BA call centre call back and say they can offer a reduced cost - hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market - however for this option it would not be possible to take payment by Visa. It had to be paid in cash to only a single bank branch in Abuja (during bank open hours) - some 6 hours and 300Km's away. By now I had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with BA over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforce. Taking this up with BA complaints - takes 2 month to elicit a first response - to be dealt with on one sided website. They do not take responsibility for the advice given over the phone, will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their APP refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on their very special conditions that apply to their Nigerian flights. My return flight to Bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of BA cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off - and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former 'flag carrier' but a worn out and low cost discount carrier.

He could not alter the cooking time for the steak. I had a very ordinary salmon fillet instead. The sweet was just two slices of Madeira cake with a spoon of jam and a spoon of something white. The breakfast muesli was horrible and the French toast was inedible. The wine didn't seem to be what was described and the orange juice seemed out of a carton.

Mike Palmer,"Montreal to London and return to Toronto. O/W leg from Montreal was the most average club experience to date. Poor third party lounge with little food choice, disappointing wines and little ambience. Boeing 787-800 aircraft was substituted by Boeing 787-900 which was good on the face of it, except the same seat number moved me from the last row of biz to the one in front of the toilets - annoying as gate staff unable to move me. With the air bridge withdrawn, the plane went tech due to a power issue. Two hours later after a total reboot of the aircraft systems we took off. Excellent updates from captain. However, cabin crew were absent during the delay with Biz passengers including me having to ask for a glass of water. Bizarrely First was blocked off with lights off and vigorously enforced with no access to the front bathroom. Drinks and dinner served promptly. My choice of fruit for breakfast had already run out. Only 4 loaded for the whole of biz with honey and yogurt offered which turned out to be a 99 cent pot plonked on a plate. No croissant offered (left in oven in error) and the orange juice has been downgraded to UHT out of a carton. On the return leg from Heathrow T5, the club lounge was very disappointing. Shabby condition, poor food and drink service by the third party provider, with dirty / scruffy toilets which I had to queue for. Worst lounge experience to date and cannot be called first class by any means. Prompt boarding on a 777-200 with the first entrance blocked off. The cabin manager was by herself and so we were pointed towards first class.  Friendly crew, prompt champagne and a prompt drinks service after take off. recovered things a tad. IFE had not changed since my flights in October which was disappointing. The amenities bag in first is now the old club world offering. Average menu with the usual suspects of Beef, Chicken and Cod but were cooked and presented really well. The promised cheese plate had already run out - only 4 loaded. (seeing a theme here) and so cheese was fetched from club. Afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland. In the race to the bottom, BA continue to cut service - especially on the food front. I don't find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. This may save money (and wasted food) but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service. In fact, the crew were the only saving grace. BA don't seem to get it. Even in premium cabins, they continue to downgrade service to save money and gain an even worse reputation as the UK's flag carrier. Biz and First Class products are dropping at an alarming rate.

Matthew Jefrrey,"✅Verified Review|  Recently flew a return trip with BA to Miami onboard one of their A380 aircraft, and what has happened to this airline! Outbound flight delayed 1 hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround. Having flown the route several times on the 747 we were looking forward to trying the A380. We were seated in row 31 which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area. From the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us! Upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldn't hear it. This went on for 9 hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was ""normal"" on all their A380 aircraft. The food was horrid and only a choice of 2 meals. I chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy. The return flight was a different A380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrival. The food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the ""breakfast"" it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle. The standards have dropped so far it is incredible. I'm certain if I sat in row 31 on Emirates or the like I wouldn't be issued with ear plugs.

Clive Drake,"✅Verified Review|  The flight started in the First Class Concorde lounge at T5. It is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats. The seat cushions need refilling. The general ambiance is quite good. A refurbishment is long overdue. The food quality and choice is generally quite poor - although the Crab Tortellini was good. Nobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinks. I had to walk the floor and find someone. All sloppy. The menus also were worn and scruffy and someone, a child I think, had scribbled on the inside, some funny cartoons. We boarded and the flight departed to the minute. All good. The Boeing 787 has a small 1st Class and I realized that the space also is smaller than the 777 option. The 747 alternative is a total disaster and I go to great lengths to avoiding flying their 747s. Food was OK. Very little wow factor. The meze was fine. They ran out of Cod - and at this point I don't think we had hit the cruise. Seven from eight passenger - and only one Cod apparently. I had the lamb which was alright but on short night flights I prefer not to have meat. My wife's allocated seat was - broken, hence the vacant seat on the flight. So she sat one side of the plane and I sat the other. Brilliant. The plane was only six months old. Given the competition on this route you would think BA would want to impress. Was it a coincidence I wonder that there was no Arabic or Asian passengers on the flight? With Emirates on this route - why would there be? We landed on time and then had to walk miles.

Clive Drake,"✅Verified Review|  The flight started badly in the so called new Concorde lounge at Dubai. I have reviewed this in the lounge section.

On the 777 the First seating is double that of a 787 and result was we were served, the entire full cabin of 17 - by one FA. He did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy. The Boeing 777 first seat is the largest of the three options (747/787/747). Mine was starting to show signs of wear. No amuse bouche. As announced last month BA have cut back this cost. Wow, a £3 saving on a £3,00o one way ticket. Well done BA. Champagne was lukewarm, as is often the case. Lamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastly. Horrible in fact. The soup was the usual Butternut squash soup (do they offer anything else or am I unlucky) and was lukewarm but okay. The apricot chicken was pleasant enough but I could not taste any apricot. A bistro product at best. Later in the flight I had afternoon tea - sandwiches. All dry and tasteless. Watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fine. Nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice. Landed without being stacked for a change.

C Drake,"✅Verified Review|  London Gatwick to Mauritius return. Our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable, but new to British Airways we were prepared to wait and see. The inbound flight commented upon here was much worse, but with many facets of the earlier experience.  We paid two supplements for the flights. A substantial fee to upgrade from Economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients - on overnight flights - we could sit together! The combined cost therefore was significant. The benefits were not. Firstly, upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood. A lady ahead of us had a headrest problem, she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated.  Throughout the flight during waking hours, passengers seemed to be a nuisance. Food - as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines, we were expecting a menu to select meals. How silly. Here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice - chicken or veg (a bright green Risotto). So, no Choice! No bread roll, no cheese and bikkies, a 'choice' of one red wine, and plastic cutlery. This was served after the attention in Economy, and may account for the absence of choice. Whatever, it was awful. It was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten. What a waste of resources. Significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration. The Premium Economy (WTPlus) cabin had no provision for toilets. It was necessary to go forward to Club, or back to Economy! It became clear early-on that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin, so back it was! During the night, with passenger debris in aisles, this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags (from headphone containers) to slip on. Is nobody in British Airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential?

We were given £300 each travel vouchers as compensation, so it means we have to use British Airways again. We ended up in World Traveller plus (premium economy).

Joe Barry,"London Gatwick to Valencia with British Airways. Boarding the flight at Gatwick was good, professional and orderly. Ground staff at the airport were lovely and check in was efficent. Onboard we got out of the gate and under way quickly. Seats were fine, plenty of leg room back in economy, although they seemed to be a little dirty when I sat down but I thought nothing more of it. During the flight the cabin crew were professional doing their duties. All friendly and welcoming. Food wise we only got complementary biscuits - a little bit of a let down - but on a short flight like this totally understandable. Drinks were fine, got the normal selection: Coke, coffee, juices etc. On the return flight it was slightly different. They seemed to have less in stock not only in the food department but also the inflight shop. Disappointed in this as what I wanted to buy wasnt avaliable.But on this return flight the positives outweigh the negatives. Flight crew again amazing. All kind and welcoming like the first flight.

Chris Malone,"British Airways state that you can check in for free. When I checked availability 24 hours prior to the flight, there were only three seats available for the three of us. I also like to have a window seat however only available seats were aisle seats in C or J. Due to online check in, I had only the option to select an aisle seat. At T5 at LHR I spoke to BA customer services who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat, only certain seats will appear available - in short, the less you pay, you get only the less popular seats with some not being available. This is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers. The aircraft was a 747-400 reg G-CIVV built in 1998. The aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and LED lighting. However the aircraft tables were not clean, leg room was poor and the 747 is ""an embarrassment"". These are the words of a cabin crew member, not me. True - the 747 is an embarrassment when compared to the new airliners. Cabin crew were very friendly however were not widely seen, only towards the start of the flight. Food was ok - veg lasagne and a nice choc mousse. However only one meal followed towards the end of the flight by a fun size chocolate bar and undrinkable coffee.

Leonard Miron,"London Heathrow to Bucharest with British Airways. To fly to disappoint. After my arrival in Heathrow T5 the check-in area for Club Europe was clearly marked and separated for the rest of the check-in lounge and a host was guiding you to the check-in line. After saying hello to the host making my way to the check-in line I was stop with an unpleasant “Excuse me, this is business class”. Like a naughty school boy I returned to the lady and show her my boarding pass which allowed me to access the “exclusive area”. Check-in was smooth and I was airside in under 20 minutes. Enough time for some duty-free shopping in an airport already decorated for Christmas. Being a little bit hungry I was looking for the “light meals or snacks especially prepared for you” and “drink from our World Wine bar” as BA promised again on their website. The only  I made was some sad sandwiches and after checking 4 empty bottles on display I found some warm French white wine. Therefore, I decided to cut my time spent in the “comfortable private lounge” and treat myself with some Costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the terminal. Waiting for the promised menu which “features irresistible meal options crafted to perfectly match the time and duration of your flight”. Couple months ago a tasty plate with canapés was offered to passengers in Club Europe. In the London-Bucharest flight I was offered the eternal option “beef or fish” with, indeed, a nice polite smile from the Purser. The tray looked like an Economy tray on a Tarom or KLM flight to Bucharest. No salad, an overlapping end-of meal option of cheese and lemon merengue and a fish which was the blandest food I ever had onboard. When I was still looking for my “very British experience” the tray was taken away. Coffee and a second round of drinks were served shortly after the main meal service was finished. I couldn’t stop wondering where that smooth, stylish service from my last flight went. Of course, the crew was polite and nice as much as they can, shaping their enthusiasm according the product offered to passengers. And another odd element: no other drink service; you needed to ask for another drink as the crew was busy to stop the Club Europe toilet in the front from leaking and flooding the entire front galley.",2.0,10.0,"""to fly to disappoint""",2016-11-03,A320,Business,Business Class,LHR to OTP,2016-10,no,LHR , OTP

Michael Laing,"I was very disappointed to find that British Airways are now a very 'middle of the road' airline compared to a decade ago. Why? Firstly, compared to my only other flight in an A380 (Qatar Airways) there are more seats crammed into the BA business. On the outbound flight, only 1 of the 2 upper deck toilets was working and on the return flight my in-flight entertainment screen was broken which meant that it was not visible and kept springing back to a near closed position. The only possible solution the steward could find (as there was a critical bolt missing) was to wedge it with a cork which sounds very 'Flintstones' for a 21st century airline and whenever we hit slight turbulence the cork kept popping out and removing the screen from view (very annoying when you are half way through a film). The flat bed and window cabin storage was good but the beef that was my chosen main course was tough, tasteless and quite inedible. I gave up after 10 minutes of trying to cut it and chew it. They did at least have a nice bordeaux red wine. The staff did well enough.

Geoffrey Wyndham-Jones,"Outward flight Kuwait to London was on a refurbished 747: flight was on time, cabin crew were hard-working, breakfast was a full British, and excellent, in-flight entertainment was AVOD, and with a wide selection of movies and a huge selection of classical tracks. The flight was smooth, and the information from the flight deck kept us up to date on the progress of the flight. The cabin crew even managed to find the last miniature of single-malt scotch for me (good job, guys). Transit through Heathrow was hassle-free, and the flight to Edinburgh was on time, this time on an Airbus 319. Again, the service was on time, the cabin crew efficient, the flight smooth, and the bags came out at Edinburgh with no hassle. The return flight was equally good: prompt departure from Edinburgh, easy transfer at Heathrow, and on-time departure to Kuwait. This time, an un-refurbished 747, with the small seat-back screen, so I did not bother using the entertainment system. The evening meal was the dreaded ""chicken or pasta"" (come on, BA, can't we have a change) but edible and tasty, and the cabin crew were professional and unobtrusive, passing through the cabin regularly with juice and water on this overnight flight. Overall, the flight was up to the usual standards I expect from BA: I was safe, comfortable, adequately fed and watered, and all four journeys were on time and hassle-free, with a professional set of cabin crew and clean, tidy and well-maintained aircraft.

Instead I decided to pay £385 to fly in British Airways ""Business"" class. What a mistake! On arrival to Heathrow's Terminal 5 I tried to enter the queue at zone B as directed by one of the information signs. I was told that the staff had decided to close that so I had to go somewhere else. I joined the queue at ""C"" instead but was told when I got to the front that business class checked in at H. I made my way to British Airways business class lounge, which was crowded, dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a run-down bus station than an airline's lounge. The place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates, cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room. It was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where I waited for my flight. The gate was announced and I made my way to gate 10C where the flight was being bussed. I was in seat 3D. It was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom. The whole point of spending £385 was legroom and I didn't have any. I asked the flight attendant if anything could be done.

There is no point BA even having a customer relations team as it seems there hands are now firmly tied to be able to do anything for a loyal customer when things go wrong. I recently spent over £4000 on a flight to Singapore, outbound being First and inbound in Club World. The plane was a fairly new A380 and on the outbound journey, the plane developed issues in the toilets where the toilets were not be drained properly. The crew on board did their best looking after things but still wasn’t a very pleasant experience from the passengers (and the crew might I add!).  On the Inbound a few days later, we were delayed by 3 hours because of a pump issue in the toilets where there was no running water throughout the entire plane (must have been the same aircraft as the outbound). The ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didn’t feel it was fair departing on a 13 hour voyage with no running water in the toilets. It meant no running water to flush the toilet (although the suction system still worked), and not running taps to clean ourselves, and of course no tea of coffee facilities. 3 hours had passed and the crew decided to depart anyway, the answer was to load the plane with loads of bottled water and wipes in the toilets but no tea or coffees throughout the whole journey (they had to get the plane to land back at LHR just before the 3 hour delay to stop each passengers claiming 300 EUR under the EU compensation policy (the plane landed back to LHR 2hr 54 min late!). To top things off, after landing back to LHR, the ground crew from BA forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in the bags delivery being delayed by a further 1hr 30 min. So in summary, I get home 5 hours later than planned with toilet issues on the outbound, which created a bit of a smell around the whole aircraft, and toilet issues on the way back delaying the plane and making an uncomfortable journey on the way back and seriously delaying my arrival back home with the baggage issues added to it. Everyone has the right to get a decent amount of compensation in this situation regardless of the class they are travelling in - the answer from BA customer relations was 15,000 Avios Points!

Paul Frankel,"My wife and I have been flying British Airways short haul in Club Europe for several years and until recently have been more than satisfied with the service provided. Noticeably, this year that service has become far more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience on this recent flight to Malta ex Gatwick. Departure time was 0750 and we arrived at Premium Check-in at 0620 to find only one member of staff manning the desks serving First and Club. There were at least 10 parties waiting in the queue, some of whom defected to Economy desks which were heavily manned with faster moving queues. Only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the Check-in lady left much to be desired - robotic, unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description. It would have been good to have been informed that the No 1 Lounge was available in the absence of the BA offering, but no mention of a lounge was made at all. The No 1 Lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load, but that is another story. Boarding was fine, but the in-flight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best. The meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered until after all meals had been dispensed. Clearing the meal was even worse. The flight was in final approach to Luqa when, returning from the toilet, I saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her I-pad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the Captain announced ""cabin crew to seats for landing"". Should I have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this lady's games session? Appalling - and such a contrast to several LHR-PRG early morning flights over recent years when it has been a joy to fly BA.

Clearly BA's cost-cutting measures have been primarily concerned with turning economy travel into the genuine 'cattle-class' experience. They really need to up their game to compete with Singapore Airlines and Emirates - who deliver economy class travel at a completely different level. BA - where do I start? Cramped seats - even felt extremely small to the children (6 and 8) and little leg room. That feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel, let alone 12. The food was laughable - yes, it says on the marketing blurb there are 12+ menus to choose from, but it fails to mention that they are inedible. I thought the children's meals of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet - the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush. The entertainment system just about kept the children entertained - but the high hopes of kiddie rucksack, quality 'kids' treat food and a warm welcome for the under 12s was completely lacking.If you have a choice go with another airline.

My flying companion didn't want to splurge on a 1st Class ticket so she was in Business Class. It wasn't long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst she's seen. BA has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight, meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when you're asleep. Well I sprung for an $850 upgrade for her and all was well. Until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart. Here's where BA's systems again breaks down and their computer isn't working to locate the bag in the hull. 3.5 hours later they locate the bag and we take off. We land 3 hours late at Heathrow and miss our connection to Nairobi! No one to assist you; head off to another terminal to customer service, wait 30-40 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a Kenyan Air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on BA.

On our return flight I had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since I couldn't use my 1st class ticket. No, can't do that and you'll have to apply for a refund. Meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis! I was told later that that is ""promotional"" and to hell with a paying passenger.

Come on British Airways. Really. I have flown BA long haul on two journeys in the last four weeks. First from LIM-LHR and now LHR-DEN. I know that BA has refurbished some of their B747-400 and B777 but the rest are a disgrace. As a flag carrier, what message does this send to the rest of the world? On a positive note, the cabin crew are always polite (sometimes to the point of being passive-aggressive), but this is a humourless service. Even London Underground has moved from the dated uniforms. The in-flight catering is lack-lustre. I choose vegan because the standard meals are truly awful. You now even have to pay for the snacks between meals (unlike KLM or LATAM). I understand the economics are difficult, given that some nations subsidise flag carriers, but small and low-cost changes would make a major difference. Firstly, smarten up the staff (have you seen the LAN uniforms?). On the last flight, one crew member hadn't shaved and it wasn't designer stubble. Get some humour training into the crew and just make passengers flight comfortable. The IFS systems are so dated that they match the reruns of old BBC sitcoms/ soaps offered. On a positive note: 1) I believe BA is a safe airline and the crew professional. Big bonus point for me. 2) When there is a problem, BA is efficient in sorting it out. 3) Communication from the cockpit is usually good.",4.0,10.0,"""this is a humourless service""",2016-10-07,Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to DEN,2016-10,yes,LHR , DEN

Mike Palmer,"Toronto to Lisbon connecting in London (outward) and stopover in London (return) with British Airways. A mix of Premium Economy and Economy. Easy check in at Toronto where the staff are great and the club lounge as usual was clean, welcoming and well run. OK boarding with juice and water offered on boarding. Bizarrely, no sparkling wine offered (""Sir - we only offer sparkling wine on flights from London"") No hot towel after take off but menu card offered. One round of drinks followed by dinner. Steak was overcooked, dry and with a greasy gravy - the worst meal to date. The biggest insult was the breakfast which has been downgraded from the ""muffin or nothing"" to a basket of smaller muffins, chocolate and cereal bars plus tea / coffee and juice. Just when you thought BA couldn't stoop any lower, they manage to find something else to nickel and dime. Good club lounge in T3 with decent showers. The flight from London to Lisbon was one of the best short haul flights for me. A younger mixed fleet crew were really friendly, offered great service and a prompt drink and snack service - a tasty roll (2 bites) and a desert (1 bite) with second drinks provided on request. Returning from Lisbon, a dreadful bus transfer to the aircraft, a more sullen and older crew with average service with the mini savory roll replaced by sweet or savory snacks (shameful that BA are increasing the sugar on offer across most flights with the current diabetes debate). The BA lounge on the B gates at T5 remains my favourite lounge with plenty of space and some peace and quiet. Onboard one of the old 747's with the old configuration with PE in front of biz class with juice, water or sparkling wine offered on boarding. My IFE had frozen before I sat down and even after reset had a mind of it's own. The safety video was abandoned soon after starting for a manual demo as there were clearly IFE issues across this aging 747. I finally gave up watching TV as the channel kept changing. No hot towels again. One drinks round and on asking for the little bag of pretzels, I was told they had be cut by embarrassed crew (at around 10p a bag - really?) A vile coleslaw starter, a choice of steak or butter chicken curry which I had and a small pot of chocolate pudding completed dinner. The chicken was tasty but not a business class entree (as claimed) by any stretch of the imagination. Tea and coffee but no after dinner drinks (had already been cut). The biggest insult in this continuing degradation of service is the scrapping of the second meal. The sandwich has gone with either 1 cookie or single finger of chocolate with tea / coffee with clearly embarrassed crew (again). This constant reduction in the PE product with the small stuff can't go much lower - there's only the seats and space left! Ironically, whilst in Lisbon the announcement was made regarding short haul food and drink being charged for in economy. BA are being disingenuous to suggest that people are asking for improved catering - yes, they're asking because you've cut the service back so much in the first place. I'd pay for a decent M&S sandwich but I enjoy my free drink. Charging for tea / coffee and juice - even Air Canada haven't stooped that low. I really worry for BA's future.

Secondly, why do BA offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose? When I fly with Aeroflot, you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your tickets.

K Thomsen,"Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways. Fast check-in by friendly staff at LHR. The Galleries lounge was as always were busy but seats were comfortable and the food ok. Boarding started approx. 50 min before departure with boarding through L2. Unlike most of the Middle Eastern airlines we were just pointed in the general direction of our seats rather than shown to them. Aircraft was an older 777-200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart, the IFE screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. Very much like Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class seat, these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle. And the ying-yang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple. Welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed. Dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished. Starter and dessert were ok, but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste. Also there is no dine on demand facility, you eat what you are given when it suits the crew. The crew were friendly but painfully slow. It also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. Breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. It was a quick and efficient service, a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. Breakfast was not great but edible. We landed at Bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given. Bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration. It is clear that BA have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the Middle Eastern 3, the Asian airlines and even the US airlines. They could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product (seats and cabins) and improving their soft product (food, service, etc), especially given their current price point.

Colin Barry,"✅Verified Review| We flew Melbourne to Singapore via Sydney on 1 September with British Airways. Our preferred airline is Etihad but we decided to try BA as we secured a very competitive First fare. I have never flown BA before but have heard not so good reports, so was a bit apprehensive. We were delighted with the service from Qantas (BA flys out of SYD) in Melbourne in booking our bags through to Singapore. The boarding in SYD was very smooth and we were warmly welcomed by the very professional cabin crew. The 777 First is a 1-2-1 configuration and we had the centre seats with the drop down privacy screen. Departure (1500) was on time and the 9 hour flight up to Singapore was very smooth. Cabin staff were very helpful and attentive. The was ample room to stretch out although we did not makeup the sleeping option as we were connecting in Singapore to go on to LHR. The food was lovely as was the choice of wine and drinks.

Tony Banwait,"✅Verified Review|  San Jose - London Heathrow - San Jose in September 2016 in Premium Economy. Was so excited when British Airways announced the new San Jose service earlier this year. Driving up the 101 to SFO had become a tedious task with traffic getting more and more congested. So was relieved to book out of SJC, a ten minute drive from home. My only one gripe with BA is not being able to select a seat at time of booking without paying an additional fee which should not be necessary in Premium Economy. Night before travel, I was unable to select a seat during on-line check-in, so next day I proceeded to the airport only to be told no seat was available due to over-booking. Was provided an $800 compensation credit card to fly the following day which I gladly accepted. The Boeing 787 is a beautiful quiet airplane and a good choice of aircraft for this route. Was given juice upon boarding and a hot towel. Only one drink service after take-off and only one shot of whiskey was provided. Dinner service included a choice from the Club World cabin menu. Full English breakfast prior to landing. Return trip, given glass of champagne upon boarding and hot towel. Lunch was a Filet of Beef. Mid-flight snack box was a let down and afternoon tea included a pizza. Cabin crew were OK and nothing exceptional on both sectors.

E Ivers,"✅Verified Review|  Bahrain to Boston via London. First time flying BA after flying Qatar, Emirates and Oman Air business class. Check in at BAH was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area. BA uses the Dilmun lounge, which is basic but adequate. The flight from BAH to LHR was on a 777. The seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow (similar to premium economy seats, and marginally larger than the economy seats) though reasonably comfortable. When fully flat there is not much room, and people over 6 feet will struggle. There was hardly any storage space, and the IFE screen was very small and of poor quality. The food was very average (I had the carrot and pumpkin soup). Cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired. The lounge in Heathrow is large, but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably. The bathrooms in both the main BA lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get. The quality of food in the lounge is average, though the wine and spirit selection is decent. The flight from LHR to BOS was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777 - old and tired with cramped seating for business class. Cabin crew were a bit better on this leg, though still disengaged. The food was of average quality, though the wine list, while small, was good. Overall, BA has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts. The lounge is sub par, particularly when compared to the Qatar lounge in Doha, or even the Qantas / One World lounge in LAX. The business class ticket was reasonably cheap, though I can now see why.

Ian Robinson,"We flew from Heathrow to Kos on Tuesday 13th September departing at 07.25. As the flying time was between 3.5 and 4 hours long, we had contemplated flying Club Europe but with identical legroom to the economy seats, it didn't seem worth the money. We checked in around 05.15 and having previously paid to reserve our seats, everything went smoothly as most of terminal 5 seemed very quiet. I had tried to find out in advance what food (if any) might be offered on the flight as we would have preferred not eat breakfast at 06.00 in the terminal. However, despite knowing people that work for British Airways, it seemed quite difficult as the web site is rather ambiguous. Having said that, I did find out that the food offered depends on what band your flight is classified as but try as I may, I couldn't find the LHR to Kos on any of the bands. In the end we had tea and toast at Gordon Ramsey's which was expensive but a lot quieter than the other outlets serving breakfast. Boarding was on time although we did have to catch a bus to somewhere near terminal three which took around 10 minutes. The plane seemed little more than half full which obviously speeded up boarding and we left a little early. The cabin crew were polite, friendly and efficient and we were offered a sandwich and a drink for breakfast, which was fine. As we had a spare seat in our row of three, it effectively meant that we had the same space as Club, which made the flight a little more comfortable. We arrived a little early in Kos after a slightly bumpy landing but we were through customs and had our bags within half an hour. Overall a good flight and BA must have a tough job selling their Club Europe seats unless of course passengers want to, pay hundreds of pounds for lounge access and a hot breakfast.",9.0,10.0,"""cabin crew were polite, friendly and efficient""",2016-09-25,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to KGS,2016-09,yes,LHR , KGS

First the flight was delayed of 2 hours and since we had to make a connection in London to go to Geneva, we only had 45 minutes do so and it was a nightmare. No one to helped us, we had to run like crazy in the airport. We had to pass security and immigration one more time, we finally made it but we were the very last ones to board the plane to Geneva as it was about to close is door. I was shocked that British Airways did not provide us with any assistance, obviously they do not care about their customers. On our way back, the flight from Geneva to London was late by more than 40 minutes, and we had to run again in order to catch our flight to Atlanta. We flew in premium economy that does not even have its own bathroom, when you are in premium economy, there is only one bathroom for about 150 people and it is a shared one with people in economy. The food is non existent, one ounce of salad and four once of a ""so-called"" meal + dessert and watery coffee. You will be left hungry, so don't rely on their food because it is more than a huge disappointment. We paid $3800 for this trip and I regret choosing this airline. Premium economy is not worth the extra fee, you only get 7 inches more than in economy but that's it. You will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than in economy. That's it.  I will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested to make a flight connection in London Heathrow, please make other arrangements as it is a huge airport and British Airways flights are late.

The cabin crew were trying to serve coffee in the middle of the meal in order to disappear as fast as possible. They reappeared at breakfast, which was the BA version of a ""full English"" as it was on the outward trip - something yellow which pretended to be egg, but the rest was OK. Landed on time.

Mark Dixon,"✅Verified Review|  Abu Dhabi to Heathrow return. Probably one of the worst flight/travel experiences me and my family have had to endure! From what was supposed to be a joyous occasion for us as a family taking our daughter to the UK to get settled into university turned into an experience that will make sure that we never fly British Airways again. First when checking in in Abu Dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new Boeing 787. Of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communication. Passengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on, eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at 10 am for check in. The actual flight time was 14:00, then the plane was delayed yet again. British Airways staff were no where to be found! Eventually a supposed British Airways manager arrived. We then couldn't check in because the system was broken, after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled in Uni.! Arriving at Heathrow, two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed. Then on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for Uni was missing, apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it is. Again no communication from British Airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answers the phone. Sad thing is that in the move to Uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag, when we explained this to the BA phone operator, she was told that was probably not the wisest decision. Thank you BA for the great advice. Now sitting on the plane returning to home to Abu Dhabi (same plane) 6 days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine.

P Barry,"✅Verified Review| We flew as a group of 4 from Heathrow to Krakow in Club Europe. The aircraft was clean and newish so had the new ""economy"" seats in the Club section. I would like to know who at British Airways sanctions the use of these tiny seats in Club (I know its nice to have the middle seat blocked but I would prefer a bigger seat to sit in - maybe BA should have a look at Turkish Airlines Biz cabin!) The service outbound was just adequate - one drinks round, then a dinner service (BA872) which was edible but slopping / dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least. Are the crew trained to do this or was it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger? In all, the outbound journey was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating. Now for the return - what a joke! Nn lounge at Krakow - that's right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet! The flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours, so by the time boarding started it was a scrum (priority boarding abandoned) to get through the gate as most passengers were so fed up. British Airways prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits. Once on the plane the same tiny seats, although we were winners all round as we managed to bag 1A and 1C so at least we had some leg room. The meal service on this leg really did make me giggle. The steward offered a shriveled chicken salad (leg meat skewers), or get this, a boxed sandwich. I actually had to ask if that was it? He replied ""yes"" to which I replied ""so who's eaten all the food?"" He laughed and actually said we were lucky, and if I had any food with me could he have some! And I'm not making this up. Once at LHR it took 1h for the bags to turn up by which time the Pod service to the parking had stopped (and that turned into a complete drama but I won't go there on this ocassion). So - what did we get for our Club fare to Krakow? In my opinion very little, and what we did get was rubbish. If anyone is thinking of going to Krakow with BA my advice is save your money and fly economy (with another airline), and spend the saving having fun there. In fact choose another airline since BA on this route are just a joke. I have been Club Europe hundreds of times over the last 20 years and the gradual decline in the product has now just about reached the point where once I have used up my 300K Avios it'll be Bye Bye BA for good.

Maurice Hill,"London to Johannesburg return. Still waiting for a reply, after 6 attempts via email, post and phone to make contact. On flight BA 0055 to Johannesburg the inflight service was the worst we have ever experienced. We took off around 19h30, and were only offered a drink at 21h30. This was the only drink offered that night. Dinner was served at 22h30, no drinks accompanied this. We were surprised to see we were sitting in the back row of the plane, which was not what was shown on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our seats when we made the booking. We did not have a choice of meals as they had run out, all we were offered was a very poor excuse for a mushroom risotto, which was inedible. It took over an hour for the trays to be cleared away. Breakfast was served to the special diets around 04h30, waking the entire section where we were seated, then the lights turned off for another hour until we were offered an equally horrible breakfast. Coffee was not offered at all - the amount of liquids offered was below minimum requirements, if we had not taken our own water with us we would have had a problem. When we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip, no waste had been collected during the flight, the cabin staff were surly and uninterested. Prior to this flight we tried to avoid the “back of plane” issues by paying an additional £56.00 for exit row seats. The payment was accepted and receipt issued via email. When we went to check in online our original seats had been allocated again. When we arrived at Johannesburg airport we were told that the seats were no longer available and had been allocated to other passengers. No apology or explanation was given. Not the way we wanted our holiday to end. The service on this flight was as to be expected, regular drinks offered (water throughout the night), the only negatives being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast. Cabin staff were very good. We have not received a refund for the £56.00 paid for the exit row seats, and I await an explanation as to why these seats were not allocated to us. Even though we were flying economy, we expect a level of service and edible food. If the back rows are to receive less or no choice on food and drinks then they should be charged less. This is unfair and bad business practice. Upon speaking to other people who have flown with BA, the general consensus seems to be that only first / business class passengers seem to be valued, and our experience confirms this.

G Trenton,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Larnaca. I went into the British Airways app on my phone 20 seconds after online check-in opened, and totally disappointed to see only 4 seats available to choose from. This is the second time this has happened with British Airways in the last few months, who really should not be offering an online check-in service if you not given a reasonable choice of seat selection! I called them to enquire why they do this, to which the reply was that most seats are ""restricted"" on online check-in.

Yet when I looked yesterday at the option of paying £15 for a seat reservation before online check-in opens, there was a good choice available. If British Airways really want to charge extra for choosing a seat, and make it almost impossible to have a seat choice for those not paying, then they should abolish the online check-in as it's clearly not providing the service it should do - Online check-in means being able to choose from several seats, not being unacceptably limited to 4 seat choices only, just 20 seconds after online check-in has opened!",4.0,10.0,"""only 4 seats available to choose from""",2016-09-14,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to LCA,2016-09,yes,LHR , LCA
J Forlen,"✅Verified Review|  No online check in is available from Dubrovnik so everyone checks in at the airport. Lounge in Dubrovnik is OK but refreshments poor, but better than being in the busy main departures area. The in bound flight was late and we were therefore late departing. No priority boarding. Cabin again not very clean probably because they were trying to minimise the delay! No newspapers available, when there are only 4 rows in business you would thing BA could provide them in the premium cabin. So called 'Brunch' was served, which was a few sad looking pieces of ham and cheese with a tomato, lettuce leaf and cucumber. Very poor for what is scheduled as just under a 3 hour flight. This to me is cost cutting too far and not sure how BA expect to hold onto premium passengers who are paying a lot of money for their tickets.

S Simpson,"✅Verified Review|  Took a domestic flight from Knoxville to Atlanta for onward British Airways flight to Heathrow. Went to BA to check in only to be told that they did not have my reservation so I needed to resolve it with my travel agent. Check in staff not bothered and bordered on being rude. Finally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agent. Lounge in Atlanta was mediocre at best. Flight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals weren't anything special. I'd say BA First Class is average at best when compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines. My baggage didn't arrive at Heathrow so had to go through the rigmarole of raising a case with BA lost baggage - it was finally delivered almost a week later. Overall, not the kind of service that you would expect when flying First Class. Raised a complaint and received a response after nearly three weeks (and four follow up calls to customer relations), who said that since my agent had booked my Knoxville flight that was due to land in Atlanta less than 3.5 hours before the scheduled departure for the flight to Heathrow, their system ""automatically took my booking off"" - I don't know whether this is normal but I've never come across this issue before in all my years of flying.

I was buying my ticket in April, so early. As BA Executive Club Gold member I had reserved already then my favorite seat on this aircraft type, 51D on upper deck at time of buying the ticket. In AMS, when checking in for that flight, this seat was still granted, 2.5 hours later at gate I was reallocated to 14G on main deck. First no explanation, then that they ""could make a family happy to sit together"", but they could not tell me if this family was traveling with children or not. No other seat available due to a full flight. Just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to 13B, a seat a little further away from the restrooms. But still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck. - I have gotten already 2620 EC tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me. I am so regularly flying with them, they know my preferences: upper deck, aisle seat and as much in front as possible. I am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person, but upon their reaction I guess this was not the case.  Communication is marketing and this was very bad done by BA this time! Why should I be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits?

K Haymes,"✅Verified Review|  The many problems I had with my outbound flight paled in comparison to my return. On arrival at T3 from another carrier I went to the BA baggage check in and was told that unlike every other major carrier in a major hub airport anywhere on the planet, BA cannot possibly transfer bags to my departure terminal, T5. The agent made it clear it could be done but that she would get in trouble. Fast Track security was woefully slow and incompetent. When I arrived at the gate boarding had commenced. Though I had purchased a business upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service I had received on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items and despite management's false statements in their replies to my earlier complaints that ""Our hand baggage allowance at two bags with a 23kg limit for the is also one of the most generous"", despite the fact that the flight was not full and more than half of the bin space in business class was empty, I was forced to check my bag carry-on compliant bag. The flight attendants were rather shocked about this and later apologized for the gate agent's unwarranted behavior. The flight was okay with the same uncomfortable coach seats in business class and an inedible food offering. In all a waste of money for BA's ""vaulted"" business class ""experience."" The recent Economist article about BA's race to the bottom service tier and the reneged promises made along the way speaks volumes about management's hostility towards customers and especially BA and OW elites. The asterisk on the Oneworld baggage page singles out BA as the only carrier in the group who will not allow it's own elite fliers and those on OW to have a checked bag on the lowest and only competitive fare BA offers.

R Simon,"✅Verified Review|  Vienna - London Gatwick - Porto in March 2016 in Economy, VIE-LGW 2o minutes early, LGW-OPO almost on time after a 20 minutes departure delay. Web-check did not work. After having entered all the required personal and passport details manually, the system informed me that “no web-check-in is offered for this flight”. Quite irritating, as this information could have been easily shown at the start of the procedure. Having Oneworld Sapphire status I used the manned premium check-in counter and was able to score an aisle/window seat. This worked fine with no lines but required to be at the airport earlier than intended, as BA charges extra for all seat selections (even for a middle seat at the back of the plane). Boarding for both flights was fine and hassle free. Service on the VIE-LGW leg was rather lacklustre for BA, but cabin crew was professional and the flight deck - as per usual for BA - great. Much better FA’s on the LGW-OPO leg and again flight deck excellent. Full bar service on both flights and a sandwich was served as well. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE, which is on the poor side, rather small and cramped, with limited food options. However, the hot item of the day tends to be of good quality. Snacks and drinks fall in the discount category. Lounge experience in LGW was very unsatisfactory. BA closed their own lounge at LGW to give up the space for another airline’s lounge and uses pay-per-entry No 1 Lounge, which was so crowded that even finding a place to just sit down was a challenge. Furthermore food and alcoholic drinks have to be ordered at the - slightly chaotic - bar off a menu. Food is then delivered to your seat; a time consuming process in a lounge that is filled beyond capacity. My understanding is that this arrangement will last well into 2017 before BA opens up a new lounge. Why BA gives up its own lounge space in its hub airport to accommodate another airline is beyond me. Overall solid experience in the air, but not so good on the ground. Will consider BA for further travel in Economy short haul, if fares are competitive, but will avoid departing from LGW.

I enjoyed the food on the plane but my sisters friend who flew with us is a pescetarian which means she only eats fish and not meat, so the crew said that's no problem and gave her a disgusting baguette with tomato, but she didn't like it and there was no other choice for her.

I booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when I went to check-in online the BA website said I had been sold a seat-only flight.

I have to be upfront and say the flight from London Heathrow to Boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. Over the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as I see them are all resolvable. However, the return leg was like flying with Ryanair. There were only 13 people in the cabin. There were no slippers, 2 of the menu items I requested were, in the words of the crew ""invisible"", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. The chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. My father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. We were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be woken. There was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. Once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. Finally, we collect our suitcases, which I have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. BA have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. When comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for USA and Etihad First for east bound, BA just doesn't cut the mustard any longer I'm afraid.

Try travelling with a 2-3 year old through the chaos of terminal 5 in the summer months without a stroller. With a tight 1 hour lay over we waited over 25 minutes for our stroller- the only reason we got it (ground staff forgot) was because the older and very caring pilot went down the stairs himself to get it! The younger staff could care less and left us and 2 other families alone waiting. They could learn a lot from the pilot. Also every single flight on our journey ended up leaving 1-4 hours late (a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it!). The good in the lounge and on board has suffered as well.

Richard Tobin,"✅Verified Review|  I was booked to travel British Airways from Heathrow to Dublin airport in Ireland. I arrived at the airport within the permitted check-in times and was held up by a longer than anticipated queue. I went to a check-in bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues. I was asked to place my bag onto the conveyor belt and issued a boarding pass and baggage receipt. The woman behind the counter then took the boarding pass back and after a few moments I asked her if there was a problem. She nodded and said her computer system would not let me board as my bag had been offloaded even though the bag was still on the conveyor belt and she had issued me with a boarding pass. After 15 mins she told me to take my bag and go to a different area for help. It was bizarre. I joined a second queue where a very helpful man explained that the first person I dealt with had not checked me correctly due to timings. He made a telephone call and as my flight was delayed by almost one hour he told me not to worry and to make my way to through security to the gate. Boarding was not efficient. One would expect better from BA. The queue was poorly managed. The cabin crew with one exception were frosty and functional. One cabin crew member, an older lady was superb and I saw her help a young mum with a baby and answering questions from 2 Japanese people with limited English. This member of the cabin crew was a superb representative of her airline. My seat was not clean and there were crumbs on the floor. The captain made very clear announcements and there was a nice drop-down screen to show the route of the flight. A cup of tea and a small packet of crisps were offered.  My bag did not arrive into Dublin with me and so I had to join a queue for Swissport. This is where my nightmare started. A uniformed woman who said she represented BA told me my bag would “most likely” not arrive until tomorrow. I asked her if the bag would be on the next flight and she said no and suggested that I leave the airport and that a courier would deliver the bag to where I was staying. I took her advice only to receive an automated email that same evening to inform me that my bag had indeed been placed on the next flight. Over the next few days a nightmare began. I spent many hours calling Swissport and their courier DPD. To be fair the DPD staff were helpful and told me the reference number from Swissport was wrong.

B Richardson,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow - Vancouver - London Heathrow. First impressions could have been better as this flight departs from Terminal 3, rather than terminal 5 at Heathrow. The departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates. However the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it. Once on board I found the cabin to be very clean. Unlike many airlines, BA offers economy seating upstairs on the A380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft. However the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual, which could be an issue for those with roller cases. The IFE system provided is excellent. I also ordered one of BA's new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal. This option was well worth taking up, offering an improved choice and quality. The service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where British Airways seems to do consistently well. If I have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 9-10 hour flight. Arrival at Vancouver was on time and I was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes. Processing through security for departure from YVR was equally efficient. The return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one, although arrival in London was an hour late. However the relatively quiet cabin on the A380 meant that I was able to get some sleep. Unfortunately the arrival experience at LHR terminal 3 was no better than the departure one. A lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slow-moving, snaking line to clear immigration.

Chris Martin,"✅Verified Review| Flew London Gatwick to Tampa. BA Club World (Business Class) is a great way to travel. Unfortunately due to renovations at LGW, British Airways are having to utilise a lounge so it wasn't as restful as may otherwise have been but once complete I'm sure that standard will be resumed. On boarding it was nice to be ""welcomed back"", a small but nice touch. Straight after settling into our seats came complimentary drinks, warm towels and our menu choices. BA does a great filet steak and the desserts were fantastic. One of the things I really love about BA is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it comes to their cabin crew. The more ""senior members"" really do know their stuff - the things that only experience gives you and this flight was no exception. Superb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks/ drinks are available between the regular drink/meal service. The only downsides for me are the seating arrangement that means that those in window or centre seats have to step over other passengers when those passengers are fully reclined and the IFE which really does need an update. I know that the second point is being addressed on the older aircraft.

Late departures on both flights but arrivals into Sydney and Singapore were on time. Still good to note they provide toothbrushes even during day flights.

Started badly - at check-in and gate boarding World Traveller passnegers are made to feel second-class citizens, but this seemed worse at Bengaluru (choatic) than Heathrow. The plane itself was packed to capacity, probably because this is the only direct carrier on this route. World Traveller is a 3x3x3 configuration. I had chosen an aisle seat in the centre (seat 38D) at the rear to minimise risk of disturbance from other passengers. Leg room is actually pretty good for economy and the new style of seat has plenty of space underneath. Seat width is OK. The adjustable headrest is better than that in Premium Economy (World Traveller Plus) although the seat base is hard. For a 10 hour flight I recommend sitting on the cushion. Service was variable - the VOD in my seat did not work (all I could get was the map) and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt) 3 times without success. Thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff. To be expected to put up with a seat without VOD for 10 hours is ridiculous - why do BA not check them after each flight? Plenty of food (breakfast after 2hrs, in then a snack box after 5hrs, then lunch after 8hrs) but, unfortunately, while I thought sitting at the rear would mean being served first, that was not the case, and by the time they got to my row all choice was gone.

R Lloyd,British Airways standards have dropped dramatically. My flight from Heathrow to New York JFK was awful. Passengers were not given a hand towel or a menu before the dinner service. I was only given one choice of meal. The interior of the aircraft looked worn and shoddy (there was litter on the ground when entering the aircraft) with the onboard entertainment system on the aircraft outdated to say the least (there were limited choices available and the screen which was scratched kept flickering throughout the flight).

B H Wilcox,"Refusing to pay £73 pp to reserve seats in Business Class (a stunt more worthy of Ryanair) I checked in two passengers online 20 minutes after online check in opened only to find that one seat was in row 7 and the other in row 11. There was no option to change seats and no phone contact given. I tried to phone the British Airways Kuala Lumpur office but the number given would not connect. I then went to the BA Office listed in Kuala Lumpur only to find it had been closed and moved to another location in Ampang Park. Still having asked several people no one knew of a BA office. Arriving at the airport I was told the flight was full but a change of seats might be possible once on board, which proved to be the case. But I then found myself next to a family with three very small children. Although the parents did what they could to amuse the children it was always going to difficult during a 13 hour flight. It was a long night and a very difficult flight. The sight of young children in nappies wandering around is not what I expected in business class.

Justin Brooks,"Having flown on an Emirates and Thai A380 I had high hopes for a great experience on British Airways. Not so. The lounge in Johannesburg was packed and the space in general was claustrophobic. Onboard I am used to personalised greetings and warm smiles with a glass or two of fine champagne within minutes of arriving. It took BA cabin crew until the final seconds of boarding to offer any drinks, and they certainly disappeared before a second drink could be requested. Business configuration is far from personal with someone sitting directly opposite you. Seats are extremely uncomfortable for what is business class. At meal time a member of cabin crew came and kicked closed a drawer that was part of my seat. No decorum at all. I have had better service on easyjet.

Given the number of flights on this sector one wonders why BA could not have a small personalised set up. But we are talking about BA where nothing is ""normal"". Flight was rammed. I doubt if you could get a field mouse on the plane it was so full. The plane left 25 minutes late - but with a couple of gin and tonics on the way I could not care less. Seats, the usual cramped 3 into 2 configuration that is unique to BA regional business class. A lousy set up. FA's were very friendly and provided great customer service. I complained about the high numbers of economy passengers hijacking the Club Europe WCs. I am not a snob by any means - but given I paid about £450 - one way for the ticket, surely ease of use for the loo is not unreasonable. FAs were sympathetic and I filled out a complaint card.

First lounge at Gatwick was being refurbished but there was a temp replacement lounge offered by No.1 which was actually superior to to the old BA one. Flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early which is always a pleasant surprise. The seats in first may not be quite as impressive as other airlines but they are still very comfortable and spacious. Inflight entertainment was very good with an excellent selection of movies. Two areas stood out on this flight - the first was the exceptional cabin crew who managed to pamper and constantly cater to your every need without being overbearing. Most importantly they all seemed genuinely motivated to make the experience on board a pleasant one. The next one (and I cannot believe I am saying this) was the food which was actually very good indeed and a stark contrast to previous flights in CW and First.

So the area was very congested, the announcements of boarding were barely audible. The outward bound flight was uneventful (great) and as smooth a trip as I've ever had. Inbound was similar with just the annoyance of waiting for a stand at LHR for 40 minutes which spoilt a little the ending. The crew both ways were superb and professional.

G Simpson,"✅Verified Review|  Los Angeles to Rome via London with British Airways. Our flight from LAX to Rome was on time and generally good. We upgraded from Economy to Premium Economy at the airport for $382 each. We had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through Costco (Costco said we needed to go thru BA and BA said we had to go thru Costco). Boarding was not well organized. Our flight from London was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. One BA associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information. We finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her iPad. We had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure. When we arrived at that gate, we were told we would be bussed to our gate. We waited another 25 minutes for buses. Seats were fairly comfortable. Food was just okay - the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. We arrived in Rome almost 2 hours late. Coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. Our flight from Rome to London was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from Rome. Boarding was chaotic and you couldn't understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. Other people were turned back rather rudely by BA staff. Everyone seemed confused. Snack on board was small but tasty. We had to be ""express serviced"" through security in London in order to catch our connecting flight. No time to catch a snack or use the toilet. Boarding was in-process when we arrived at the gate. Then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. Seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat, the back of the seat was very close to your face. You had to ""go horizontal""in order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. Arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. Food was pretty good. On board entertainment was good. Service was slow, forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. Our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in London. We arrived 25 minutes late to LAX. I also take exception to the $90 luggage charge ""per leg of the trip"" for our 2nd bag. 1st bag is no charge but $380 (round trip) charge for the 2nd bag is very steep.",3.0,10.0,"""seats very narrow and close together""",2016-06-21,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LAX to FCO via LHR,2016-06,no,LAX , FCO via LHR

H Layton,"✅Verified Review|  London Heathrow to Newark return. Having just returned from my holiday, flying with British Airways in their World Traveller Plus class, I thought I would post my review. The week before we flew, we paid the £48 per person to select our seats so I had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together. We flew out of T5 at LHR one what I think is one of BA’s new 787 to Newark at 10.35am, and plane interior looked new and clean. We took our seats 21 J and K which were right next to the toilets. On our seats we found a small pillow, blanket, headphones and an amenity kit. I had plenty of leg room (ok, I am 5’5) and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it (he is 5’10). Although our seats were next to the toilets, we didn’t get disturbed movement or smells. Once the curtain was pulled between us and World Traveller, you wouldn’t have known we were by the bathrooms. We were offered a glass of something fizzy – water and juice were also available. Hot towels were handed out. Menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken, with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert, with cheese and biscuits. The food was ok, it was hot and tasted good. The food service was quick, and prior to the food served, drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal. However, during food service another drink was also offered. So, three small bottles of wine for the flight and I was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday. As we didn’t have anyone behind us, we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone. As there was a wall behind us, we couldn’t recline as far back as others, but it was comfortable enough. Luckily for both of us, the people in front of us didn’t really recline theirs too far. The seat was really comfortable, and even with my generous back side, I felt I had plenty of room. Although I had loaded up my tablet with films and books, I didn’t use it at all. Neither did I use the vast choice of IFE – I used to 6.5hour flight time to have some “me” time. My partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight. After food, the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing. Most people (me included) took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye. A sandwich and small chocolate bar, tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up (in my seat). The pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another 20 minutes or so. I quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up, but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets, spending 10 or more minutes in there – whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer. However, the toilets were clean. The landing was smooth and we arrived on time – I suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early, but don’t the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early? On leaving the plane I did have a look at Business Class, and without offending regular Business Class users, I did wonder exactly what you get for your money.

Y Wong,"✅Verified Review|  We travelled on BA 633 from Athens on 12th of June, 2016. The flight departed at 7.55 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at London. Nonetheless, we only got in 15 minutes late. What went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process. We had showed up early but was refused check in at Club Europe. The ground attendant at Athens was incredibly rude and abrupt. If they had explained it to us nicely, we would have been fine with it. The result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767 – a larger than usual plane. When we finally lined up, it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at Club Europe because for half that time, there was only one counter open. Eventually, a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant (unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up) and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long line-up. Eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier Business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind. Seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces, and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class. The middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat. British Airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different – you couldn’t properly enjoy it. We were placed on the last row of Business class (14) and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin. It was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end. To be fair, I think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments. Furthermore, when asked for a blanket, I was refused one on the basis there was none until I walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets. How is this fair? What principle of seat assignment did they use? The last few BA trips to Europe have been nightmarish, from boarding processes (this one in Athens was chaotic and unsystematic, they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the pre-boarding process). We were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our Exec Club, the online check-in keeps breaking down and when we tell BA that, they tell us to call in (laugh out hysterically here). In fact the more frequent you are a flyer (but not high profile), the worse treatment you get. I also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered (later on, the Cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing). I cannot blame the crew, they work with what they get.  If we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy, we would have booked economy.",2.0,10.0,"""passing off economy seats as business""",2016-06-18,Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,Business Class,ATH to LHR,2016-06,no,ATH , LHR

No transfer service for first class passengers to Terminal 5 where the security screening was insanely chaotic. Due to delays at security and the fact that all A380 flights leave from the B/C piers I had 10 minutes in the lounge. First class A380 service was fine but underwhelming compared to other carriers.

Ian Robinson,"St Lucia to Gatwick with British Airways. We checked in on line and dropped the luggage off and were quickly through security. The lounge was small but quite comfortable with a nice lady serving drinks at the bar. I asked her if she could make me a Rum Punch and despite causing a small queue, she happily made me an excellent cocktail. Boarding was well organised and the flight departed on time. On board we were extremely well looked - staff were very professional and were able to find the time to chat and make my wife and I feel very comfortable. The wine choices were explained very well with the offer of tasting each bottle. Dinner was plentiful if not that exciting but the numerous glasses of wine helped to make it was an enjoyable experience. We landed on time and after a brief scare from the pilot who said that due to the French air traffic controllers strike, there may be a delay in parking the plane, we soon disembarked and were in the luggage hall within around 25 minutes. The luggage arrived quickly and we were soon on our way home.

Ian Robinson,"✅Verified Review|  We arrived at Gatwick just after 07.30 to catch the 10.00 flight to St Lucia. Check in was fine and although security was tight, we were airside just after 08.00. Before having breakfast we checked the flight information screen which indicated that the departure gate would be available at 09.00. After tea and toast we checked at 09.00 and the board indicated that the departure information would now be available 10.00. Obviously this was the first time that alarm bells start ringing as it was plain to see that we were going to be delayed. The on screen information then changed again to say that the departure details would be available at 11.00. At this point I did venture down to the British Airways information desk but as there was a queue of around fifteen people, I gave up and sat down again. At 12.00 the screen info finally said that we had a new departure time of 14.00. During all of this time I should add that at no time was any information (other than the screen) made available to passengers regarding the flight or details of refreshments etc. Despite numerous announcements from Easyjet and other airlines BA was conspicuous by its silence. We were eventually notified of the gate number and for the first time we were told as we entered the departure area the reason for the delay. Apparently there had been a problem with the cargo door and they had decided it needed to be replaced. Despite the rather cramped departure area, everyone seemed ready to board until we were told that the repairs were not complete and there would be a further delay and if some passengers wanted to stretch their legs they could leave their boarding passes with the ground staff and leave the departure area. Eventually we boarded just after 14.30. When everyone was settled in their seats the pilot apologised again and said the repairs still hadn't been completed and a further delay was likely. We eventually departed just after 15.30 after a delay of over five and a half hours. Now I know 'stuff' happens but let's not forget that we were departing from one of BA's home airports and why they couldn't have a second plane available quicker than five and a half hours is anybody's guess. Various people writing on online forums have previously spoken about the holiday routes from Gatwick being dumbed down by BA in favour of the traditional business routes flying out of Heathrow. I have no idea whether this is true or not but I would ask one question, if this flight had been a morning flight from Heathrow to JFK, would BA have found a solution quicker? Once in the air, the flight was fine, nothing special but nothing bad and would have been acceptable without the delay.",2.0,10.0,"""further delay was likely""",2016-06-06,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,LGW to UVF,2016-05,no,LGW , UVF
M Steger,"A mediocre service on this airline flying from London Heathrow to Stuttgart, which was to be expected given my prior flights with them. Check-in process was fine at Heathrow. After security, I went to the first class lounge on the south side of Heathrow terminal 5. The lounge had no air conditioning and so was very hot as it was a fairly warm day outside - this made it quite uncomfortable. The hot food selection was poor - everything was very liquid based and looked unappetizing. There were a few bland sandwiches available as well. While the lounge itself is in a beautiful, large room, it is really let down by the lack of good food and service. Boarding process was seamless at the gate. The plane had been recently renovated but the seats were highly uncomfortable. There is very little legroom available and if you're taller than 5'11"", you're knees will likely be touching the seat in front of you. Food offering was very limited with only a small bag of chips on offer and one drink. Flight attendants were courteous but didn't really go beyond the minimum.

C Neal,"✅Verified Review|  
Going against the grain somewhat I have to say that I truly prefer flying with British Airways over Emirates on the London Heathrow - Dubai route. Having tried both airlines several times I am definitely going to side with BA on this one. Firstly, BA offer some really competitive prices on this route. If you happen to have a few Avios tucked away then this flight can be a real steal. Secondly, out of LHR, BA really does have the best terminal. Okay, so Terminal 3 for Emirates isn't the worst terminal in the world but I much prefer Terminal 5. Spacious, light and with good dining options. As for the aircraft, well it's a choice between choosing the passenger pleaser that is the A380 or the retro classic that is the B747. I'll happily fly in either, although even after the refit the 747 is still showing it's age. As an economy passenger I have found the product on British Airways to be perfectly reasonable. The seat pitch is average, seat comfort is average, IFE screen size again is average. You get a choice of the latest blockbusters and a few other options. With Emirates you have a huge IFE, thousands of films to choose from and slightly better seat width and pitch. However, I've also wondered what the appeal is of choosing from thousands of films that I have no interest in watching. I'd rather just take my iPad preloaded with films I actually want to watch. The lack of WiFi isn't a huge concern for me. Hopefully the GoGo 2KU product BA is installing from 2017 will be more robust. Now for the catering. As an economy passenger I'm not expecting much but on the last few flights with BA I have been pleasantly surprised. The food has not only been edible but also really quite tasty. Where BA falls down is on presentation which is quite frankly awful. It's also the little extras that I notice. A pre-dinner drinks service. Coffee and tea offered throughout the cabin. Real cheese and crackers to finish off the meal (As opposed to soft cheese - I'm not 5 years old). With BA you also get a more substantial snack prior to landing. It's just a little tuck box but it is far more generous than the Emirates economy offering. I've found the crew to be hit and miss, in fairness, I've found that treating crew in the same friendly and warm manner as you expect to be treated normally brings out the best in them. The recent newspaper deal with the Murdoch empire is a nice touch. Along with the Daily Hate and 'i' newspapers to choose from you also get The Times, The Sun and Financial Times as complimentary options. Arrivals for BA at DXB is a bit of a nightmare. Terminal 1 immigration is something else and the journey from runway to stand can be epic. However, the new concourse D for departures is really nice. Not too blingy. Overall, a pleasant flight.

Nicholas King,"I was very impressed with the World Traveller Plus experience on British Airways from London Heathrow to San Francisco. Obviously this is a very new aircraft for BA, but the seat and service experience really were very good and so much more pleasant than an economy flight. I had a window seat, so benefited from the extra space afforded by the location of the storage cabinets underneath the windows. The seat was very comfortable situated on the upper deck in the A380 which is a very quiet plane to travel in, and I enjoyed a couple of movies on the large screen with great sound via the supplied noise cancelling headset. The food was pretty good, and alcohol freely served. The only negative experience was being turned back from priority boarding at LHR even though I have Ruby status with BA. The ground agent was a little condescending in the way he handled it to be honest and of course I felt embarrassed in front of the other passengers, but the signage by the priority boarding lane clearly indicated that Ruby travelers had the benefit of priority boarding. I was a 10 year qualifying Gold Card holder on British Midland, but BA has chosen to not recognise all the frequent travelers who achieved this status over a decade of loyalty to the airline they bought claiming they had no lifetime member status in Executive Club, however I believe this is now something they do in fact offer.

Carlo Mantovani,"Flew British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana. Where to begin? I'll start with the check in at Gatwick, having checked in online I was expecting a relatively simple baggage drop off, how wrong could I be. 4 desks servicing every flight, we arrived at the airport 4 hours before the scheduled departure time and spent 3 of these in the baggage drop off queue. Due to the slow service many passengers were getting called forward to jump the queue so as to not miss the flight. The staff on the desks looked thoroughly miserable and spent more time talking to each other than dealing with the customers. Security checks were surpsingly efficient but due to the time taken to drop off the bags we had no time to visit any shops and had to go straight to the gate, despite having arrived 4 hours early. Onboard the aircraft things improved a little, the food was good and the crew very attentive however the IFE is very dated on the Gatwick based 777s, my screen kept jumping every 3-4 seconds and stopped functioning completely an hour into the flight. The crew tried to reset the system but when it reset I no longer had the option to choose what to watch and could only watch the old style video loop. This wouldn't have been a problem for me if not for the fact that I paid an extra £38 on top of the ticket price to choose a seat.

Andy Magowan,"✅Verified Review|  This was a flight from Gatwick to Bermuda on a 777 with British Airways. The aircraft was clean and reasonably comfortable, and the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. I am 6ft tall and normally have problems with the leg room offered in economy (Aer Lingus, I'm talking about you) but there was ample leg room. Indeed on walking through premium economy and club world on exiting the aircraft I didn't notice a big difference in leg room. I haven't flown BA for quite some years and had vague memories of the inflight meals being particularly shoddy. Not this time though. My meal was reasonably nice (chicken korma) and my fiancée had no complaints either with her pasta dish. The crew were round regularly with complementary soft drinks as well as snacks and glasses of water or pure orange. The IFE had a good selection, though one gripe is the positioning of the controls. There is a small controller built in to the top of the arm rest. This controller controls the IFE as well as your reading light and call button. More than once I accidentally pressed the light and the call button with my elbow while shifting position. A small gripe but it was quite annoying. Another gripe is the adverts you have to sit through when starting to watch a new selection.

Clive Drake,"There are many negative reviews on this site - its almost embarrassing to admit to flying BA. I am adding another one. I have flown BA on/of for 37 years. I guess that makes me qualified to write a review. My main gripe is the total lack of value for money. The erosion of quality and services and the sky rocketing prices. This flight from Heathrow to Barcelona and the return - accentuates the lack of value. Barcelona flights operates out of Terminal 3 at LHR. Quite why BA use this ageing and outdated terminal is a mystery. You walk miles and if you are unfamiliar with this point, as we were, - you end up running a panicked race to the gate. Its worse on arrivals. Immigration and passport control was a zoo.  The T3 Business lounge is mediocre, Plastic tables and chairs. The most awful selection of dried out bacon baps and dried out omelettes stuffed into baguettes. The seating areas overlooking the airport was cluttered with newspapers. There was plenty of booze. Flight left on time. The meal inflight I could not be bothered with. FAs all fine. On the return the shared lounge was surprisingly good. More comfortable than T3 at LHR. Ageing plane. Mediocre afternoon tea. Frumpy FAs who ""forgot"" to hand out our Fast Track tickets to help speed up through immigration. (We got held up for half an hour.)

C O'Hanlon,"Outbound flight with British Airways from Gatwick to Orlando was good, chose seats at the back of the aircraft and ended up with 9 seats (3 rows) between five of us, so we could stretch out and relax. Food was surprisingly good, served chicken curry with basmati rice for lunch and a chicken caesar salad sandwich for afternoon tea. Plenty of choice of drinks and snacks available throughout the flight in the rear galley. Inbound flight was less good. Took the cabin crew over three hours to do the drinks and dinner service, leaving less than 3 hours to get some sleep prior to breakfast being served. My son's children's meal took nearly two hours to arrive by which time he was starving. Dinner was chicken with dumplings which tasted a lot better than it looked.

R Klingelholler,"✅Verified Review|  Family of 4 adults flying British Airways from Bangkok to London,and I wished I had done my homework first regarding aircraft type. The only outstanding experience on the flight was the service from the crew but that's where it stops. The seat was old, the footrest would not operate correctly. As a Oneworld Gold Frequent Flyer was able to get 1st row in Premium Economy. (2x2 by window). The pop up screen from the armrest would not stay in one position, the screen was cloudy and scratched making it impossible to watch the inflight entertainment so after an hour was put away. 12 hrs with no entertainment is a very long time. The food was probably the worst I've ever experienced, the main meal comes from the Business Class menu, not sure what happened in the galley but the steak was like concrete, could not be eaten, hence left behind (noticed other passengers did the same). Mid flight snack ok. Light Meal prior to landing was inedible, a lasagna that just the look of it put me off. Hence left behind. 12hrs 30min flight the catering is very average. We have now rebooked (at a premium cost) to fly back via Kuala Lumpur on the Boeing 787 with the new Premium product. Interesting to see how that compares.

The flight from Pisa to London Heathrow on an A320, was flawless. The check-in was normal, flight was fine, there were IFE and food and beverages served. I proceeded to my next flight, which was operated by American Airlines. Boarding was on time, which is the only positive thing about this flight. The seats are old, IFE had no selection of movies, when I searched for action and adventure there was only one film! How was I supposed to stay entertained on an 8 hour plus flight if there aren't any movies? The food was awful, and the best thing I can say is they gave lots of drinks. The food didn't sit well on the stomach, and trying to drink an alcoholic beverage just made it worse. I ordered a vegetarian meal, and was served a very bland and flavorless pasta. When breakfast was served I was given the same dish. The crew was careless and seemingly did not want to hear about my problems. There was no way to sit comfortably and I dreaded the flight since the moment my foot stepped aboard the plane. Arrived ahead of schedule, another positive thing. Once I cleared security I found that there is a British Airways flight, actually operated by British Airways, that arrives at the same time.

P Trevatt,Flew British Airways business class from London Heathrow to Santorini. The seats are a joke and in reality are economy seats sold as a business class package. No leg room and BA attempt to improve the experience by blocking the middle seat for a 2x2 configuration (A/C and D/E). The problem is they use an upended tray which is bolted into the seat and cannot be moved. At least If the middle seat was vacant couples could stretch across and free up some much needed space. Our flight was delayed by a hour traveling out and so we were stuck in our seats for almost five hours. Flight was full in business (9 rows taken up) and quickly became stuffy. Since this is an economy seat at a business price it is almost impossible to work out BAs business strategy.

Gerard Dunne,"London Gatwick to Amsterdam. I was bumped off this British Airways flight as a result of a change of plane, to an A319 I gather. The process was not well handled, and it appeared that some staff and/or standby passengers were given priority, although others also missed out I understand. The main issues were lack of clarity at the airport as to what the issue was, last-minute confirmation of offloading (which left us short of time to take another flight), a poor process for transferring airports (I had to bus from Gatwick to Heathrow), and poor follow-up when I queried matters afterwards. BA refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised, repeatedly citing privacy. I checked with a friend who's a UK privacy legal specialist, and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby, so it appears to be a refusal by BA to respond. I also raised the transfer with BA, as this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket, which meant I missed a transfer bus. Better to issue a ticket, or a voucher that can be used on any service that day, with BA to arrange it so with the bus company. On the positive side, I was compensated per the rules, and did make a BA flight later that day, which was OK. Nonetheless, this could have been handled much more smoothly, and I'm afraid British Airways customer service on the ground and in follow-up let them down.",2.0,10.0,"""bumped off this BA flight""",2016-05-04,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LGW to AMS,2015-11,no,LGW , AMS
Mike Palmer,"Flew Toronto to London in British Airways club world on avios and companion voucher. Prompt check in at Pearson with friendly staff. The club lounge is well run with dinner served as this is a sleeper service. A good choice of food though though the wine list remains unimaginative. The lounge is too small when busy. Additional toilets are needed - too few with queues before the flight was called. Friendly staff on the flight with lights out after takeoff and a tray service offered. The dessert and cheese and drinks was perfect before an ok sleep. The flight is too short for a decent sleep and the club world layout is now dated and in a real need of a re-think. Once cutting edge, it's not fun being stepped over by a stranger and there is a real lack of privacy. Breakfast was ok with the hot muffin being a confused offereing. Returning from Heathrow 10 days later started with a very slow check in process - unusual for T5 with agents blaming cancellations from the previous day spilling over. Went straight to the club lounge on the B gates which is a hidden gem - quiet, well stocked, few children and in good condition. Pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to first on arrival in the lounge . A superb flight with BA first at it's best. Decent vintage champagne before take off, friendly, engaging and professional crew made the experience really first class - impressive given the cabin was full. Great Rose Champagne, an excellent wine list - especially the reds, and well cooked food. A movie, afternoon tea and we arrived head of time into Toronto. The bags almost beat us off.

Our return flight was better, and we enjoyed the glass of fizzy prior to take off, which is a nice touch, and is something that other airlines do in Premium Economy.

A Davies,"London to Johannesburg, and I decided this time to fly with British Airways given they fly there with the A380. I was quite looking forward to the experience of flying Business Class on the upper deck of the A380. I needn't have bothered. Following an uneventful few hours in the Galleries Lounge it was time to board, straight onto the upper-deck. My business colleagues before me passed through the gate without problem, however I was told to wait a moment as there was an issue with my boarding card - ""just a moment sir, oh it looks like you've been approved for an upgrade to First which is on the lower deck - no, sorry, my mistake - you're still in Business upstairs but I'm afraid we've had to move you from your selected seat"" (the one I'd paid the not inconsiderable sum of £80 to reserve in advance by the way) - but not to worry, it's still a window seat"". Except it wasn't - it was seat 50A, a windowless seat next to the toilets. The journey itself was uneventful. The food a bit of a disappointment without any flavour, my beef main was dry and rather tasteless. The wine was very good. Entertainment system not bad, though not a patch on the likes of Emirates. The staff friendly and efficient enough and I managed to sleep a few hours. I wrote to BA to complain about my change of seat and the unprofessionalism of telling someone they had an upgrade when they hadn’t. I had to chase up twice for a reply. The one I eventually got was pitiful and as impersonal as could be with a stock answer about the need for them to occasionally change people’s seats for operational needs The biggest issue for me with BA’s Club World however is its ridiculous layout whereby people have to step over each other’s legs - I don’t know of any other business class product which has this and it leaves BA well behind the competition. Although not my favourite airline, BA could do worse than take a note of their partners Iberia which has a staggered layout but offers direct aisle access to all. The situation whereby you find yourself starring at strangers until one of you decides to raise the privacy screen is also far from ideal and surely not safe as the cabin crew have to constantly lower it to pass hot food and drinks over your neighbour. Can’t help but think that BA have missed a real opportunity to shake things up with their new fleet of A380s. Whilst some airlines have been creative and had on-board bars, lounges and showers, BA has just packed in as many seats as possible – there are 7 abreast in Club World upstairs and 8 Downstairs which is staggering and an insult when paying premium prices. I should have known better having flown on one of BA’s other new additions to its fleet last year, a Boeing 787 to Toronto, which also was extremely claustrophobic. I returned home from South Africa upstairs on a Boeing 747 from Cape Town to London. The plane might have been older but the experience altogether more pleasant.

Other than this, all 4 flights we took were late, our son was given child meals we hadn't booked, the choice of meals was one of only two options both were disgusting, one of the seats was broke on a new A380 and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable in that you could feel the metal frame as there is no padding in the seats.

Albert Wong,"✅Verified Review|  Flew London to Beijing with British Airways. The flight leaves from Heathrow Terminal 5, normally Beijing flight leaves from B Gates, so I made myself comfortable at the B Gate lounge which is 100 times better than the two A Gate congested lounges before the flight. It was a good flight and day flights are more comfortable, though quite full. The BA Club seats are configured 8 across and the seat is not as wide as competitor's, but just enough. CX may have better seat but BA sometime offers good value. The service is good. It has a Chinese crew and unlike with Cathay, the crew are always the same on this route (because they are based in China specifically for the London route), so a frequent flyer may be recognized and get treated better.

Round trip was overall on time without delay. Online check in was easy and got to pick out the seats I wanted. Picked up the boarding passes at the airport without any problems. The food was above average and the cabin crew were courteous and professional. Drinks were frequently served or could be picked up from the galley independently. Washrooms were clean. Overall a satisfactory experience. However, one thing almost all travellers on the YVR-LHR route will notice is the age of this aircraft. I think it should be replaced soon, since this is a very popular route. I flew in late March and return beginning of April, being low season but the cabin was still full. I think this flight deserves a newer aircraft like the A380. Particularly, the back of the seats are very thin and one can feel every scratching movement if the person behind tries to retrieve items from the front pocket.

A Chinnery,"London Heathrow to Athens on BA642 (2/4/16) and returned on BA643 (9/4/16). We decided to take a break from the low cost airlines and fly British Airways to Athens as we had found very cheap flights (£50 per person per way) and good flying times. As someone travelling with us is registered blind we could reserve seats before others on both flights with ease, priority boarding was given as well. Online check in was smooth and boarding passes on the outbound were printed off. On our flight out to Athens we were given a choice of a hot or cold meal. As I had something to eat before; I passed, but this was great given that some people would have been transiting quickly and wouldn't have time to eat at the terminal. The night flight on the way back was also good as meals (one hot option only) were offered with free drinks and pillows were available. Flight attendants were professional on both flights. Both flights landed early (one 35mins early!). If there is anything I could ask BA to improve on is allowing one desk open at Athens for all flights of the day for anyone that arrives early and just wants to print off boarding passes or offer self service kiosks at other airports outside of London.

My boarding card said the gate closed at 1840, and when I hadn't heard any announcement by 1830 I asked the BA man at reception if there was a delay. I was very dismayed when he casually said ""yes, about 1 hour 30 mins"". I was very unhappy they had not told us earlier, or asked if we needed help getting home in a more timely manner. There was a time when BA would have tried to reroute its premium passengers, but this man told me his duty manager had specifically told him not to do this. He told me that if I wanted to switch to an earlier LHR or LCY flight I would have to go back landside and buy a ticket for those flights. Onboard I had my first experience of BA's new club Europe, wherein the middle seat is covered by a tray, to give the perception of more space, without actually giving you a wider seat or more legroom. From my experiences of BA business class in both long and short haul, over the past year, it is very sad to see that BA is focussing on making changes which make it more money, rather than changes which benefit the passenger experience. My meal was plonked down in front of me without telling me what it was, and it wasn't at all tasty. But a stewardess gave me great customer service by giving me a plastic glass to decant my bloody mary into, so that I could hold on to it on approach to LGW.

I don't understand the comments from people who think the 747 is tired or worn out. Not a bad ride in economy when the person in front of you doesn't recline their seat. I sat in one of the ""twosomes"" (seat 52A) in the tail. The food on this leg was bland, the continental breakfast was a disappointment. I would buy seat 52A again if I was traveling on a British Airways 747, but be advised there is no wall next to 52A that you can lean on to sleep. Second leg was on an A380. I sat in the tail of the upper deck in seat 82A. This time, the young woman in front of me reclined to the maximum as soon as she could and kept her seat that way the entire 11+ hours of the flight. The A380 is a very nice plane and the overall experience was pleasant despite extensive turbulence the majority of the way. The upper cabin on an A380 is amazingly quiet. The food on this leg was far better with an English breakfast served prior to landing in Jo-burg. I would not play for seat 82A again because there are two boxes under the seat in front of 82A that limit foot room, but I would play for seat 82B, which is an aisle seat. IFE on both legs was pretty sad but I'm not one for popular culture. Cabin attendants on both legs were polite and did a very nice job. BA ground personnel at Heathrow were very nice and helpful.

A Asprakis,"PHL to LHR and return, both in new cabin. British Airways has degraded its economy product to the point where US airline companies may actually offer a better service. On the 777, BA has removed the toilets in the rear to cram in more seats, causing long queues for the remaining restrooms. The new economy seating feels incredibly cramped, the food on offer is of poor quality and of smaller portions, and avios accruals have been significantly reduced for low-cost fares - I just don't see any reason to continue to fly this airline.

British Airways has degraded its economy product to the point where US airline companies may actually offer a better service. On the 777, BA has removed the toilets in the rear to cram in more seats, causing long queues for the remaining restrooms. The new economy seating feels incredibly camped, the food on offer is of poor quality and of increasingly smaller portions, and avios accruals have been significantly reduced for low-cost fares - I just don't see any reason to continue to fly this airline.

J Tydeman,"We flew British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana in economy and flew back in Premium economy. Was it worth it? Well we didn't pay too much more, so probably overall yes - just about. But other than slightly more legroom you don't get much! Same food as economy as far as I could tell. Main meal was nice. Breakfast was not good enough for an airline of this supposed calibre - small cold cheese croissant and muesli bar! Only one tea/coffee round and then they whipped round to collect the empties. We got to board before the economy passengers but that's no big deal. We had to pay extra to secure seats at the side in a pair. Otherwise, we would have had to sit in a block of 4 in the middle which we don't like. I begrudged paying the extra for this to be honest. Captain was cheery and informative, and apologised endlessly for the short delay leaving Punta Cana. Crew were polite but not friendly. Ours was an older guy who had an air of 'I've been doing this a long time and I'm pretty fed up with passengers'. Whilst I can understand this,  if you feel like that about your job, you need to move on. The flight only landed slightly late and having made up a lot of time en route would have been on time had it not been for air traffic congestion at Gatwick which I can well believe.

D Finlay,"My first long haul flight with British Airways for some years and what a mistake! I flew Premium Economy expecting it to be on par with its competitors especially Lufthansa or Virgin Atlantic - not so at all. At the airport, it took over 1 hour to check-in; there was no dedicated premium economy check in nor a premium economy boarding queue at the gate either; perhaps the plane would be a little special? No, not at all, it was an old Boeing 777 that had been designed to maximise seats at the expense of comfort; the cramped space of the premium economy cabin with its 2-4-2 seating was comparable to economy and was light years behind the modern and spaciousness of other airlines, and sitting in a middle row seat meant you could not physically squeeze past the person next to you to the aisle unless you woke the person up or you took your chance to stand over them and hope you manoeuvred successfully. Stupidly I had thought that competition would eliminate most differences between airlines. How wrong I was - avoid British Airways on the Hong Kong route if you are flying on a Boeing 777.

BA would not let us off the flight. Captain came to First Class and answered questions, which was a nice personal touch. When we finally got going, food and cabin service were very mediocre. BA First Class seat is a very, very poor product, and entertainment screen slow. IAD-LHR return on the A380 in First Class. The A380 is a wonderful aircraft, woefully let down by the poor BA First Class seats and service, the seats are barely Business Class by modern standards, and the dinner service was inelegant and almost inedible. Crew on return were impersonal, and keen to get the dinner service over. Finally, BA Customer Relations (based in India) responded to the 3+ hours delay by declining my claim with an insincere form letter. They also don't appear to have a good grasp of English. Overall, the end-to-end experience with BA was poor, and evidently they don't care. It is far, far, short of a First Class experience. This is what you get with a quasi-monopoly to the USA from London. The only merit was the superb A380.

Cheery, friendly crew - biggest problem is the excessive hand baggage allowance permitted on BA. Selfish people take huge cases on board, filling up the lockers so everyone with more modestly sized items can't get a look in. Cabin crew quite stressed trying to move cases around lockers to get everyone sat down. LHR-PHL upgraded to the rearmost group of two seats on Row 35 on  Boeing 777-200. BA has now cheekily increased the cost of these to £48 each - used to be only £33 like the rest of the cabin. Wisecracking captain over the tannoy made the flight a little more entertaining - again great crew, I could eat the meal for once. Only thing that went wrong was the IFE on my seat crashed in the last 90 minutes of the flight - I could only view the flight tracker. On a side note, I wish BA would upgrade the album choice, they haven't changed it in the last year. Flight was on time no delays. Inbound PHL-LHR I reserved a seat for £33 each, but note you cannot buy the back row on the middle group - reserved for the crew. Plane encountered severe turbulence between Nantucket and Newfoundland, crew had to rush the drinks and the meal service as a result.  No apologies from the pilots about this which BA usually does. LHR-EDI problems about excessive hand baggage exacerbated on the smaller A320.  It was the same steward by sheer coincidence that served us on the outbound shuttle a week earlier and he did remember us, and asked us how our holiday in Philadelphia went! Otherwise flight was pleasant and did what it said on the tin. Overall it was a good value trip - I booked it through BA Holidays, and it being off-season meant the total cost was £940 (before seat upgrades) including 8 days car rental. One observation however it that it is now clear that BA cares little about its economy passengers (who now seem to exist to make up the numbers) - everything now seems to be geared around their high-spending Executive Club members. Avios earning has been drastically cut in the World Traveller cabin class, so a discounted fare now only attracts 0.25 Avios in the mile. Therefore a transatlantic flight to the East Coast of the USA (which used to get 3250 points), now only attracts a measily 815. Pretty pathetic really.

Mark Kamensek,"Washington to Heathrow with British Airways and I have to say that the IAD ground crew and inflight crew are fantastic. I sprained my neck just 2 days before departure and was given the option to pre board, which made all the difference. The flight itself was amazing - the A380 is just like a rock in the sky, I didn't feel a thing. The seat comfort on the upper deck in coach is more than adequate - in fact it reminds me of economy plus on United. The premium economy is more like domestic business class on most US carriers (older style business class not the new business first). The major downside - as I write this in the middle of my trip - is the ground staff at Heathrow. They are hard to find if they even exist. I'm in the middle of a terminal to terminal connection, still wearing my brace - and when asking about gate assignments and better options for seating, the best I got was a brusque ""sorry that's all there is."" When you see someone limping away from your desk - at least ask if they'd like some assistance getting to the departure lounge. I know that with United, they may not offer club access for free, but you can at least buy it and I have found their ground staff at Heathrow far superior to the UK's flagship carrier - unfortunately.",7.0,10.0,"""flight was amazing""",2016-02-28,A380,Business,Economy Class,IAD to LHR,2016-02,yes,IAD , LHR
Barry Dennis,"First time my partner and I have flown British Airways for some years and we will not be returning after our flight from London Heathrow to Cape Town. I booked the flights several months before and had to pay £40 to pre-select our seats both ways (£160). On both outward and inward flights my entertainment system was not working. Attempts by staff to re-boot the system failed so I had to cope with two 12-hour flights with no entertainment. On the flight out my table was broken. When I raised this with the crew, I was told that a previous passenger must have ""bounced a child on it."" Dinner was very good but breakfast was appalling. There was only congealed egg and bacon. When asked if I could have a Continental equivalent, all I got was a stodgy choc chip muffin and some fruit juice. The plane looked generally tired. We had to share one inflight magazine between us. The pillows and blankets were a very uninviting brown colour. My partner's entertainment system did work but she did have to get a stewardess to use a spoon to release the handset from its position in her seat.

The Concord Lounge at LHR has seen better days - ordered a bacon sandwich which arrived far too promptly and was limp and rather pathetic, so left it! Champagne on boardng was warm as was the water. Nuts were pleasant. Seat area was genuinely filthy and had not been thoroughly cleaned with remnants of the toiletries bag between the seats from the last passengers. First choice of food not available, which is unacceptable in First. Then a whole row of seats just stopped working so my seat was in a permanent 20 degree incline. Staff attempted to get them working but to no avail. We ended being split up, partner on row 4, me on row 2! Nice start to our honeymoon, thanks BA. Cheese selection on the menu had changed and was offered a scrappy piece of paper to advise new selections. Staff upgrades are commonplace on BA in First and the cabin had by my reckoning, 5 paying passengers and I'd say about 4 staff upgrades (all of whom appeared after we had been pushed back from the gate). These 'mates' of crew are showered with attention throughout the flight. Personally I'd have preferred to see some of the full fare business class passengers upgraded with staff passengers thankful for a seat, but BA seem to think it's acceptable for staff to travel in First. If you're on flying on business and hoping for an upgrade, I'd say you're chances are pretty remote, unless of course you know one of the crew for that flight!

On the outbound flight, the plane was half empty, so it was nice and spacious. The BA Boeing 777 is an outdated plane which has been used in their fleet for many years and has not had a refurb I would say in about 10+ years - I suppose this is why the flight was so cheap. The staff on board were friendly and efficient. The seat pitch is large so I could sit for 9+ hours comfortably, the seats despite the plane being old, were comfortable and not showing signs of wear. The entertainment system is what shows the age of the plane, one of the smallest screens in the industry.

I was looking forward to my first flight on the Boeing 787 -  so much so, I switched from Singapore / LHR to KL when I discovered the 787-9 operated on this route. The new plane is very nice indeed - the so called ""new"" - New First is not. BA trumpet they have listened to customers and this revised version was to be the new pace setter. Wrong. The FAs on the route were great and dinner was adequate. The chicken satays followed by prawn and mango salad was fine. The wine was also fine. The cheap champagne nowhere near to Krug as served by other carriers in 1st Class. The usual cheap stainless steel cutlery and boring glassware and chinaware - we have to get used to. The seat is definitely more constrained than the 777 and A380 1st Class; its tighter and smaller. In bed mode - it is like sleeping on a park bench. So hard. The ridiculous ""island"" design for the table and retractable dinning table is worse than the 777 and A380. When lying on your side it digs into your back. The seat's narrow profile becomes very obvious. You have to be a gymnast to get into and out of the ""compartment"". I am 6 4"" tall and not overweight. I did not sleep hardly at all when compared with the A380 flight I took to Singapore last month. The TV screen is larger and fixed - which does not lend itself to a companion dinning with you as on the other aircraft. Its on a slight angle as well slightly facing away from the viewer. The AV remote is small and overly complicated. There is no WiFi. There is no window blinds as on the other aircraft. The windows can be dimmed to ""black"" - so you have two black orbs staring at you through the flight. BA seem clueless when it comes to a top end 1st Class. I will avoid this plane in future.

J Gwizdala,"London Heathrow to Vancouver with British Airways. Outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours. Email was received on the day of travel. It did take 2 calls to the airline to establish if one could arrive later. On the first call, there was such a poor understanding of the question that the operator thought we wanted to rebook flights. Fortunately we were cut off as I think the call might have continued for the rest of the day. Second call was more successful and a direct answer was given, no matter how unwelcome. Printing your own baggage labels was a new experience at LHR (I am not a frequent air traveller). A sign of the times perhaps but I did get the impression of going through a self checkout at a supermarket. Not much to say about bag drop off. It was neither efficient nor inefficient, just a linear series of a few tasks performed by someone doing their job. The young chap at drop off said that the delay started as 10 minutes at the beginning of the week which had turned into two hours by Friday. At the gate, I did wonder why those with priority boarding moved to a different seating area - all of 3 metres away. I suspect people need to be seen receiving value for higher ticket prices, because they will of course get there first! The flight was just about adequate. My video screen did not work and despite requests to 2 cabin crew this was not rectified - well I was ignored. Fortunate, as the film and TV choice was poor.  I do not like airline food that much. There are plenty of food outlets past security to get something decent to eat. Never really drink the wine. Beer and spirits hard to get wrong. Return flight was only made better by the jet stream reducing the flight time by an hour. Again the flight was just about adequate. Did not eat the food as I had a salad from an outlet at YVR - good value. Flight attendant said it looked better than what they were serving. The seat in front of me was broken so it reclined further than it should. The only solution provided by another attendant was to get up walk around a bit, and stand at the back. Whilst the broken seat was not the fault of the passenger in front, she did not want to be reasonable.

The seats are comfortable and are OK as long as you do not have a seat where someone has to step over you or you have to step over someone else. The inflight entertainment system uses a dual prong plug in for their inflight entertainment system so I had to use their headphones which are not comfortable for long periods of time.

Her bag fit in BA's measurement gage frame, but the BA desk agent did not like how I put it in. Apparently it has to not only fit, but it can only be placed in the gage with a straight up and down motion only. After complaining that her requirement was unnecessary, the desk agent relented in a huff. BA also required that I pay to chose my seats after buying a 7000 USD business class ticket. I am a Alaska MVP Gold member so I can fly BA as a partner airline and get mileage credit, but I cannot book seats without paying.

Mark Freyton,"Gatwick is not my first choice but for Naples with British Airways it is the only choice so we reluctantly booked a return Club Europe ticket for a treat. Check in fast and friendly, and fast track was amazing, we were the only people using it. The BA lounges at Gatwick have been closed and we were sent to the No 1 lounge which BA is using instead. To say it is less good is an understatement. £8 for a glass of champagne (whereas free in the old BA lounge) is just ridiculous. The atmosphere is more Weatherspoons than Fortnum and Mason and the crowd was noisy and chaotic. If what we were told is true (the lounge will be used until next year) we will be avoiding it next time and probably avoiding BA in that case. Food was small portions and service bordering on rude from the barman who explained very impolitely that they do not serve diet drinks. Once on board the crew were welcoming and friendly and the afternoon tea adequate but not exactly filling (disappointing after the rubbish we were served in the lounge). Return flight from Naples began with another abysmal lounge experience. Windowless, crowded and with very limited food and drink, again not worth the bother. Crew again were wonderful and very chatty and friendly. New layout A320 and we had booked 1 A and C. Totally unacceptable seats. No bulkhead so right up by the main boarding door. No carpet, just a rubber floor and during boarding I was constantly bashed by peoples bags and during the flight my feet were trodden on by people waiting for the toilet.

Not a huge amount of storage around the seat but my case fitted into my personal locker at the front of my seat. My partner and I were in 4E/4F at the back of the cabin, (front of the lower deck). No disturbance from the galley. Choose a window seat if travelling alone. Being a day flight, we didn't have beds made up. The cabin is classic yet contemporary and elegant. Pre-departure drinks included Grand Siecle Champagne. We both chose the tasting menu option. I didn't like the lobster starter and staff substituted a course from the a la carte menu. Food was outstanding and wine pairing worked well. To be a bit fussy, the steak was overcooked to the point of being unenjoyable. IFE was good although no time to watch movies. The screen is attached to the side of the seat and has to be docked for take off and landing (as in Club World), which is very irritating. First off the plane, although that doesn't matter much as immigration at MIA is always a nightmare. I've flown BA for many years in other cabins and cost cutting is evident everywhere. Their Club World is a joke compared to every long haul competitor but First is still a world leader.

The check-in desks were crowded out by Team GB athletes returning home from a training session and we were relieved to get the fast track treatment. The first/business lounge at GIG is one of the worst we've been in. Our seats were 1E/F and seemed marginally better than the first class seats on a 747, although still far off the standard of British Airways competitors. 1E/F also suffer from being near the galley and there was one crew member who spent much of the night talking away to her colleagues. 1A and 1K seemed to be occupied by BA employees and there was far too much schmoozing going on. Service on the whole was reasonably good, although none of the food on the menu was actually available. This was rather feebly blamed on the changeover from one month to the next. The IFE worked reliably and the large screen had a much better resolution than on 747s. Overnight the temperature in the cabin was set too high, which resulted in an uncomfortable sleep under the duvet in the pyjamas provided. The toilets on the 777 are ridiculously small and weren't well cleaned during the flight. Breakfast was the usual affair, with an atrociously rubbery omelette.

The seat - well I am very critical of this design. So much space is wasted with the ""island"" console in the middle. The designer of this seat should find another career. Seats already starting to show wear and tear. Why British Airways opted for a canvas material rather than leather is a mystery. In summary, the A380 is fabulous. Slept for about 5 hours.

M Stanger,"I was originally booked on a United Airlines flight from London to Boston, connecting through Washington Dulles, but this was cancelled because of the snow in DC. United rebooked me onto British Airways to complete the flight to Boston. Without a doubt, BA is one of the worst airlines I have flown on. Upon arriving at check in, I was told that I could only check in one bag, despite being allowed to take two bags on United. United said that I would be able to travel on an equivalent service with BA. The check in supervisor at Heathrow informed me that I would have to pay £65 to bring the bag. When I complained said ""it's not my problem"". I asked if they could call United to clarify the bag issue, but they refused, saying ""we don't even talk to United"" - in the end I didn't pay and will get it sent at a later date. The onboard service was very disappointing. The food was barely edible. The staff were loud and abrupt, providing the bare minimum service and yelling across the cabin at each other making the whole journey even more unpleasant. The inflight entertainment failed multiple times, and passengers started to be reseated because of the problem.

Hans Roloff,"Late evening departure on BA28 from Hong Kong to Heathrow, plane fully booked (pre-Christmas season) in all classes. My seat was 2K, the senior male purser presented himself and addressed me with my Christian name - I did not object, had the impression that this is part of a nice intimate atmosphere. During the flight I found out that the majority of the 14 pax in First class preferred a more formal approach and were addressed with their family names. The purser offered the champagne welcome drink and I gladly accepted, and soon my face turned pale : the champagne was almost as warm as a cup of tea. His apology came prompt, but too late. They simply had no cool drinks on board and needed about an hour - or 30 minutes after takeoff - to have the respective drinks at the right temperature level. British Airways did not control this service process properly. Maybe nobody was in charge, maybe it was simply forgotten. The plane had arrived in Hong Kong about 5 hours earlier, so there was enough time to take care of the quality of beverages. The remaining flight was ok - cordial hosts in the predominantly male service team, food not sensational, but it was after midnight, so no complaints in this respect. Seat was fine, had a nice sleep during the 12.5 hour flight, breakfast options okay, arrival ahead of schedule. So is there a reason to complain and to give rather low marks? Yes, we are talking about first class in a leading European airline. The product has to be perfect, that's part of the game in first. Serious irregularities result in harsh reaction of the customer.

J vanRooyen,"Club class on British Airways between Cape Town and London. Boeing 747-400 has the flat bed and while the quality of the cabin was inferior to the A380 between London and Johannesburg, it remains one of the better business class product. Check in at the BA counters in Cape Town would have been a breeze, was it not for the unexpected six hour delay in the departure of the flight. The upgrade from Premium to Club class made this inconvenience almost bearable. However,  Cape Town airport becomes like a ghost town when all flights but yours have departed. BA's Executive lounge in Cape Town is spacious and serves good food and Cape wines. There are free internet and computers and a friendly service, even at midnight. While comfortable, BA's Club seats on the 747 can do with an upgrade. They are configured in a 2-4-2 layout, with one passenger facing forward and the one adjacent facing backward, at the side row - the middle row has two forward and two backward facing. This is something I never understood - why facing backward because it just makes no sense. The seats are separated by a hard plastic cseparator that moves up and down with the push of a button. Theoretically, the air hostess should walk behind the front-facing seat to serve the backward-facing passenger at the window - however, on my flight the air hostess insisted on leaning over me, pushing the button to lower the separator and serving the accross my seat - after about three times this really got annoying. The problem is that if you don't raise the separator, you and your fellow passengers stare straight at each other from a distance of less than one meter. Food was satisfactory, rather than outstanding. . The starter choices were poached Norwegian Salmon with marinated prawns or an oyster mushroom salad. Main courses included Ballotine of chicken with Port, Drakensberg trout, pasta or a cold main course salad of za'atar beef medallion. I chose the chicken and it was OK, but inferior to my mother's Sunday roast chicken. There was a selection of South African Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and some good reds. Breakfast was a choice of a cheese omelette, continental or a traditional English breakfast with bacon, sausages, mushrooms and potatoes. Arriving in London, I took the supposedly fast track option - a big mistake. In theory this is supposed to expedite your progress through customs as a Club passenger, but in practice it was a disaster - there were only two or three border agents present at any time and it took 45 to 60 minutes to get through the fast track immigration - I could see group after group of fellow BA passengers clearing the slow lane long before I took the next few steps forward. BA arrivals lounge was a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of Heathrow Terminal 5. All in all, not a bad experience, but having flown on these seats quite a few times over the past 15 or more years, I really think it is time to either upgrade the Club cabin on the 747's.",8.0,10.0,"""time to upgrade the cabin""",2016-01-12,Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Business Class,CPT to LHR,2015-02,yes,CPT , LHR

Mike Palmer,"Avios points flight to London from Toronto for Christmas in Business class. Slow queue for check in though given flying just Christmas there were a lot of people and luggage to be fair. The BA club lounge at Pearson remains well run and clean. Too few toilets and a really unimaginative wine selection being the only issues. Onboard, the usual slow service taking coats (I had to ask), papers, drink, menu amenity kit - very random and fragmented delivery by an assortment of crew. The meal service was fast with drinks served first. The evening meal was average at best and overcooked, with the tray delivered with the starter and dessert already on it with the hot entrée dumped on the tray and that was it. Had to ask for cheese and a second coffee. Across the piece, you can see the cuts and money saving British Airways are making to business class. Even now - the two posh chocolates have been replaced by a unwrapped chocolate finger, no flower in the toilets, no drinks offered after dinner. The list goes on! Breakfast was nothing special with an egg and bacon muffin which is at least edible (unlike the previous bacon baguette.) Reasonable entertainment choices. Crew were the usual indifferent long haul ""I'm here as a favour to you all"" with little rapport or effort in delivering a world class service! I think the main problem British Airways have is a dated cabin product. The ying yang seating in it's day was innovative and one of the first lay flat beds. Now, crawling over a stranger to reach the isle, being bumped by people and carts if you're on the aisle, and a lack of storage space mean that the BA product is way inferior to Air Canada and a lot of the middle eastern carriers.

Alan O'Brien,"Watch out for fog diversions at Pisa! We arrived over Pisa on time, circled for 20 minutes and then diverted to Genoa. This was because of fog at Pisa and the fact that there was no instrument landing system. We subsequently found that the ILS has not been working for some time and will not be working for a good while yet. Fog is common at Pisa in the winter. We could understand a last minute diversion because of unexpected factors. However, there have been frequent diversions yet British Airways gave no advance warning that there might be trouble. We had a long wait at a deserted Genoa airport and no British Airways or other staff were on hand to assist or offer drink or food. Eventually one lady appeared to show us to a bus which took us on a 3 hour journey to Pisa. We had a 12 hour day with little to eat or drink.

On descent into GLA it opened again and hung open for several minutes and I was tempted to unclip and close it. I made the passenger across the aisle aware in case the bags fell out on top of him. Eventually, the cabin crew member whose jump seat faced up that aisle got up and closed it. We should have been sitting upfront given our ticket class (part of a longer trip), but, after service issues with BA and a long journey prior to this flight, we couldn't be bothered pointing that out.

R Simon,"British Airways from Vienna to Newcastle via Heathrow return, flights on-time. Economy on an A320. FA’s much better on domestic legs, while both times on VIE legs the FA’s were professional, but nothing more and not doing more than absolutely required. Information from the flight deck was friendly and excellent. A snack and drinks were served - snack a highly processed sandwich (barely edible) on the VIE flights and crisps/biscuits on the NCL flights. Additional drinks on request. A320 featured the new slim seats and I miss the older more comfortable BA seats with better leg room. BA has recently changed the rules and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). If one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR 75 at the airport or EUR 35 online. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checked luggage. So, BA became a low cost model, except for drinks service. However the prices do not reflect this change in service. On the last leg LHR-VIE carry-on luggage was heavily policed. Although my carry-on luggage met the weight requirements and fits in the overhead bin and has so without any problems on the previous three legs and twenty previous BA flights, I was required to check it in. It was also not a question of occupied space, as it happened in the priority line. Hopefully just a power trip by the gate agent. However, here goes the main advantage of BA, which was a carry-on policy that enabled passengers to realistically travel without the hassle of checking bags. Boarding by the same agent was again bizarre. Instead of priority boarding, there were now four different types of priority boarding, and the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood there blocking the access to the gate, so that finally it became a cattle call with everyone boarding at the same time. Another thing is, that recent changes in BA’s frequent flyer program make it impossible to reach a meaningful status even for regular flyer unless you regularly fly Club on long distance routes. Obviously, BA is trying very hard to annoy its frequent travelers. While I stopped flying Business with BA probably a year ago after they downgraded their Club Europe cabin and I was avoiding their long distance flights for a long time due to their terrible seating arrangement, I believe BA’s European economy was a great product and I was using BA regularly for those flights. However, after all these recent changes, I will only book BA if they offer the lowest or close to the lowest fare.

M Spielbichler,"Having previously flown with British Airways on their European routes, I thought I would take a long haul flight with them. I arrived 2 hours before departure at Heathrow Terminal 3 and couldn't quite understand what was going on; the queue to actually drop my pre-checked luggage was long, very long, hearing customers complaining they were standing in line for a good hour, and that there were no signs of BA taking any steps to remedy the situation. Even with my frantic tweeting at BA, nothing improved. The situation boiled down to the fact that only 4 desks were open for the general public on the day that schools finished. Needless to say, whoever was in charge that day didn't really know what they were doing and caused a lot of agro for many customers, and BA needs to take full responsibility of this. Once these proceedings had passed, I found myself boarding the Boeing 747-400 which was tired and not very well maintained. Leg room was atrociously tight, with a metal support for the seat in front of me limiting the actual usable legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good selection of films, but was made to be disappointing with the meagre 7"" to 9"" screens. The staff was very friendly. Looking after our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best to find some people seconds if they were left hungry after the meal. The meal was decent, not fantastic.  My only note when it comes to food and drink is that more water should be made available. I found myself constantly thirsty and having to go back to the galley to ask for water. All in all, I wouldn't fly with BA again using their long-haul services unless I were to fly in Business or First. The ground service is terrible.

Brian Park,"Third time flying the British Airways A380 and the only reason that we did is because it was a BA Amex 2for1 redemption. However to ensure that we maxed out the experience, as always we pre booked seats. On checking in online seats had been moved, contacted BA Bronze and reply was ""cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available at check in"". Check in, no response. On board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be ""normal"" passengers, i.e. no entourage. Seats we were allocated, lumbar and head rest functions did not operate, cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck, so onwards and upwards. Having flown BA a reasonable amount I have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on a Heathrow to LA and return last July where we had the same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out) manage to maintain a brave company face. BA Club Lounge: Again, food choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot BA? Cabin crew: Service very good and friendly. Food reasonable, but nothing that makes you say that ""that was good"". Entertainment: Poor, old ""ish"" and second rate movies, enough said. Seats: Unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. Having flown Qantas, Emirates and Qatar A380's like everybody else we wonder why BA did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. Well we know why = £££'s, Question? Does no one on the BA cabin design team wear glasses? There is no storage space, if it goes in the drawer with the shoes, you have to move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs, or hanging them over the separator. Again, competitors manage it. The seat itself, is harder than the competitors above (mattress?) and apparently I discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried, so you have one and thats it. Unfortunately, we do still have to use BA next March, but have booked Qatar again for October.

I travel regularly in business class on Emirates, normally on the same equipment. The BA configuration upstairs is quite cramped and far inferior to other Airlines, even to the extent of having to stretch over other passengers to leave your seat. In addition the staff seem preoccupied with their own arrangements and although were fine with me, were mildly irritated with the requests of other passengers, openly commenting to each other in front of me. The cleanliness of the plane also left a lot to be desired, after only a couple of hours into the flight, the toilets were disgusting with the floor awash - I don't think crew check them on a regular basis. The window seat has side stowage facilities, which in my case had a disgusting pale yellow fluid and rubbish in it.

Andrew Thomas,"I have been flying to the US regularly from England and have noticed a consistent erosion in the quality of its booking process, website, call centre and ground staff. The British Airways website is unreliable and prone to returning baffling errors even when carrying out the simplest of activities. Its upgrade path is impenetrable and designed to confuse, call centre staff do not seem to speak English and make ridiculous requests and ground staff are didactic. Examples: Cannot check in online, but via the app on a smartphone, no problem (except I wanted a printed boarding pass). Call centre staff in India wanted to speak to my 5 year old daughter when my family accompanied me one one trip, as she was on a different booking and wouldn't give me her flight reference number ""for security reasons"". No problem with ""security reasons"" when I paid BA a lot of money for the ticket. Upgrading with points or Avios fails in the middle of a transaction. The system remains unavailable to check you in for some time after, so you have to call the call centre. BA blacks out so many flights from purchasing with Avios, it's not worth trying unless you're jobless and can fly any time, and don't care where you go. In the queue for boarding my passport wasn't open at the right page and the staff at the gate admonished me as a result. On another occasion at passport control after checking in I was directed back to the BA desk I'd just come from. ""There's nothing wrong with your passport, it must be BAA. It's not us"", was the response. It took a huffing, tutting, BA duty manager to run the visa check again. I advise people to avoid BA if possible. The only reason for choosing BA is flight safety.

I asked at the check in if the seats with the bassinets were occupied by people with infants and the ground attendant responded by ""yes"". That was not the case, unfortunately. The flights were therefore very uncomfortable due to not having a place for the infant while food and drinks were served. I do not understand that when you try to book those seats with the bassinet, the system does not grant priority to the people traveling with infants.

I quickly moved on and had an excellent dinner in the Movenpick restaurant a few meters away.  Only three passenger in Club and the plane pushed back 5 minutes early.

Sylvia Goddard,"This review covers my usual return trip from London Heathrow to Dubai. Both flights are overnight and I use points to upgrade to business. It was a Boeing 777 going out and Boeing 747 on the return trip. There was nothing really wrong with either flight but I only really use them for the timings and the flat bed to get some sleep. I don't like the weird front to back 2x4x2 layout and cannot forsee how much longer British Airways can get away with this as it is so out of date with modern standards. It is fine if you get a window seat and no one attached to you. Having watched the seating pattern filling up over several months I eventually paid £136 extra to reserve a window seat both ways. After a couple of hours the bed is very hard and the storage is almost non existent. That said, the crew were polite and served well. They seemed to be older and I think that makes the difference, they understand customer service. On the return, one cabin crew in particular was very responsive and helpful in offering tea mid flight. Overall the product is outdated and this time the service was good.

A Aryan,"I regularly travel British Airways to LCY and LHR and found them to be nothing more than a glorified Ryanair in terms of service. I also flew a longer sector (Kiev to London) last week and it was awful. On the A319 they only have 1 toilet at the rear of the plane for all economy passenger. On a 4 hour flight this resulted in massive queues discomforting passenger on the last 4-5 rows as well as long waits for those actually using the loo. The food was horrendous (Chicken Kiev!) and the air hostesses were surly, abrupt and really uninterested and unfriendly. I don't want them to do the fake smile and friendliness thing, but these girls and guys were genuinely unhappy and unfriendly. As for my regular weekly or biweekly flights between Dublin and LCY or LHR, the E170 service to LCY is ok, it's punctual, and you get a stale croissant for breakfast on it. What really annoys me is how British Airways treats its frequent flyers, makes it impossible to get any meaningful benefit from BA despite having travelled numerous times with them (every other week at least!) and paid hundreds of pounds in fares that are usually well above the competition. They also have this ""seat selection"" fee for their bronze members if they book a hand luggage only fare. They cite that these fares are there to make it competitive but they really are not anywhere near competitive on routes they sell from Dublin and the treatment of regular flyers and bronze members leaves a lot to be desired (it's basically meaningless: I would have far better service on Cityjet or Aer Lingus which both server those routes, for a lower fare, while being able to choose my seat for free at check-in time).

It was a pleasant surprise with very good service and food and a pleasant ambience onboard. Almost all passengers were flying onto London and this also applied to the return run from Singapore, with almost all passengers originating in London. This means that for the return flight from Singapore most other people had slept all the way from London and were chatting and moving about the cabin, meaning it was almost impossible to get any sleep on the relatively short overnight flight between Singapore to Sydney. So, if you don't mind skipping any sleep between Singapore and Sydney this is a nice alternative when planning to fly from Australia to Singapore and return.

We flew out with Lufthansa as they were the cheapest as we usualy fly to the Middle/Far east with them and know the standards and quality they have to offer.

I am aware that the Boeing 747-400 isn't the newest aircraft, however Lufthansa had re-done the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. With British Airways the whole interior was very old and dirty, the seats hadn't been changed and the TV's in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. The food was of a poor standard - chicken meal I had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. When asked what chicken dish it was, she replied ""some sort of curry thing"" when it was actually Chicken Teryaki. The air hostess was rude, the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good, and cereal bar was rock hard. British Airways were double the price of Lufthansa when we initially booked, however I would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice.

Carl Fearn,"Geneva to Beijing via LHR. First flights on British Airways for six years - not because I was avoiding them, I just did not fly much. Used to be a big fan of BA but recent negative reviews made me a bit nervous. Well, my experiences on board the 2 flights were excellent. Cabin Services Directors on both flights were approachable, courteous and professional and team members exemplary. The boarding in Geneva was efficient, seat was comfortable for economy class and the flight departed before time. The sandwich and drinks provided were appreciated. On time arrival in Heathrow Terminal 5. The process of getting to the Beijing flight was relatively quick. The flight to Beijing was a 3 year old Boeing 777-300 series and my seat was 37A - the emergency exit seat that quite a few people have complained about because it has no window and the emergency slide box on the door limited leg room. I am 6' 3"" tall and there was more than enough space for my long legs. Bar service offered shortly after take off. The food was good (smoked salmon starter, beef/rice dish,  chocolate orange mousse). IFE was excellent (compared to the United flights I had taken to the USA earlier in the month) with a good selection of films and TV shows. During the flight, the crew came by with trays of drinks. Breakfast was a cooked breakfast with muesli starter, orange juice and a bread roll. Coffee refills were offered. The flight landed on time. I really could not fault the planes, service or food on both flights. Economy seating is cramped these days but BA seats are no worse/no better than other airlines.

Was in row 10 on both the outgoing and incoming (night) flights. Seats were not comfortable in that they were less roomy. I understand that because of the row, both the table and screen were in the arm rests, but by the time I had used a cardigan and the blanket to pad out the arm rests (very hard on the elbows) I felt very cramped. My immediate neighbour kept messing with his seat and was eventually moved as he said it would not recline. Later I tried mine (no one behind me) and, the same, it would not recline. Breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge - yuk. The British Airways check in staff at Newark are so surly and miserable. Whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that I could not distinguish what she was saying. On my outgoing trip and arrival at USA customs queue I realised that I did not have the customs entry form. Seems I should have been given one to complete by the BA check-in person. I had asked the flight attendants if there were any forms to be completed and they said they would check and get back to me. Never saw them again.

J Garin,"After flying with BA long haul for the first time on one of their newer A380s, the flight back to LHR was with their B747-400 which is my favourite aircraft along with the A340-400. Ground service at SFO was efficient. Purchased extra luggage and was still 2kg over my limit on each bag of which the check in agent was considerate enough to let me off. My guess was that the flight was not full as there was virtually no one at the check in counters. I was wrong, the gate was packed. Considering I had 3 pieces of carry on luggage, I wasn't asked to put one of them on the hold. The flight was delayed by approximately 1 hour. Boarding was smooth and efficient. Upon boarding, passengers were having trouble storing their carry on resulting in me storing mine some 4-5 rows behind. The seat is no surprise, their older product with the outdated IFE. Cabin temperature was boiling. Passengers were requesting FAs to turn it down a little which they have mid way through the flight when everyone was asleep. The seat pitch on the Boeing 747-400 is 31 inches pitch in economy class. Compared to their A380 product, the cabin felt cramped. Although the seat was comfortable itself to sit on, it just felt cramped. I had the most uncomfortable long haul flights in my entire life., the flight became more and more unbearable and wasn't able to get any sleep at all. I was constantly trying to find a comfortable position for me to have nap but it was impossible and worse when the person in front of you reclines. To make things worse, the IFE was very unreliable compared to the A380. I fly with BA frequently on European routes where their economy cabin product is negligible due to the flight times but I would try and not fly with BA's product on their B747s. Inflight meals were rather disappointing. Service was rushed and FA's showed no enthusiasm. First meal was bland roast chicken.

BA used to have a fast bag drop desk for customers who have checked in online. When I enquired as to where it was on arrival at Manchester Airport I was directed to the back of the long check in queue by a surly check in agent who stated, ""We don't have one. You have to join the back of the queue"". In that case what on earth is the benefit of checking in online?! It serves no purpose whatsoever. The shuttle down to Manchester was delayed by about an hour as was our onward flight from LHR to LAS. This flight was on one of their ancient B747-400 aircraft which was 25 years old, and it showed. The seats in economy were extremely uncomfortable for a 10.5 hour flight and there was no legroom. Inflight entertainment options were poor. I have never undertaken such an uncomfortable flight. The in flight catering was mediocre but the cabin crew provided good service. Our return flight from LAS to LHR was delayed by an hour and although we had booked to travel in and out from T5 at LHR I received an email half way through my trip informing me that we would be flying into T3 at LHR. As we were already delayed into LHR, by the time we had crossed to T5 our connecting flight to Manchester had already departed and we had to be booked onto another flight which meant we had been travelling for a total of 26 hours by the time we got home.

M Dye,"I recently got an unexpected upgrade to World Traveller Plus whilst on my way to New York. There was free cava before take-off and a random hot towel handed out. The seat was roomy and leg room was fantastic. Even more so because I was at the front of the World Traveller Plus cabin just after Club World, so there were no seats in front of me. Inflight entertainment was ok, but not as good as I was expecting. I did struggle to find things that interested me to watch as the choice was quite limited. I think now with early digital release of many films on things like i-Tunes, the days of being able to see really recent films on aircraft before they become more widely available are coming to an end. As I was at the front of the cabin I had a screen that folded out of my armrest, which meant I was looking down at the screen instead of straight ahead, which gave me a bit of a neck ache after awhile. It was also annoying to stow away. The food was good for airline food. You get a superior meal in World Traveller Plus and it was pretty tasty and filling. The pre-landing snack wasn't up to much though. It was a dull sandwich, much like those that BA hand out on short-haul European flights. A real bonus about being in World Traveller Plus is that you're closer to the front of the plane and the exit. This is useful when arriving in the US where immigration queues can sometimes be exceptionally long. I ended up being close to the front of the immigration queue as I was so quick off the plane, which meant I was out through immigration pretty quickly. I think to pay for World Traveller Plus would be quite expensive for what you get in some respects (essentially a nicer meal and more leg room) but it was a nice treat from BA and If you were going on a super long haul flight I can definitely see the attraction.",8.0,10.0,"""the seat was roomy""",2015-10-30,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Heathrow (London) to JFK (New York City),2015-10,yes,Heathrow (London) , JFK (New York City)

Onboard the A380 is BA's new 'World Traveller' cabin on the main deck at 3x4x3 configuration. BA offers 31.5 inches legroom compared to CX's 32 inches and it was surprisingly very comfortable with the slim design seats.

Drinks were served around an hour after take off. Meals followed straight after. Lunch meal option was either curry, vegetarian pasta or chicken and often for the latter. Surprisingly good but still not as good as CX. Portions could be better. Drinks were offered throughout the flight along with snack boxes. Pre-landing meal was also given with two options: pasta or chicken casserole, I went for the latter. Again, portions could be better.

Peter Dimblad,"My wife and I recently flew to California, outbound on A380 into LAX, returning to LHR from SFO on Boeing 747-400. Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy). The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The TV screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the A380. On the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as WT+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word ""Premium"" in the title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the WT+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! As you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. Based upon our experience, I would recommend the WT+ in the A380 but only when departing from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats.

N McAvaney,"Endured horrible British Airways return flights from Heathrow to Cape Town. The plane seems to be from the 1980s. Somehow the seats are really narrow, so that anyone with remotely broad shoulders spills over onto the seats next to them. I couldn't fit between a larger man one one side and a woman on the other and resorted to leaning forward for much of the flight. Thankfully a child was on one side on the way back. There were a number of flyers on the plane who had clearly done the route before as many refused to sit togther, forcing first-time flyers on the route like me to be squashed between them. The seats were also incredibly uncomfortable. The moulding on the back was took narrow and dug into my bag. I only fell asleep through sheer exhaustion, but woke up repeatedly with back pain from the seat. Other passengers walked around the cabin throughout the flight, while some resorted to sitting in the flight attendants' seats. Also the seats in front of the toilets don't fully recline. The TV controls are fixed into the arm rests which makes them uncomfortable to put your arm on and you inevitably press one of the buttons accidentally. The TVs themselves are about 30 years old, small and poor quality. The selection of movies was not great. It was very hot onboard the plane, and passengers repeatedly asked for the air conditioning to be turned up. The service was good on the way out, but the return flight service was poor. The staff appeared disinterested. One flight attendant responded rudely to me when I asked if I could use the overhead locker above my seat that had her bag in it. Another told the child next to me, when he asked for Sprite with his dinner, they had run out. Even though I saw a flight attendant drinking a can of Sprite 30 minutes later. Generally they seemed more interested in rushing through the service and stuffing their mouths than helping anyone. My call button was ignored twice.

The only way I found it was cancelled was by going into my original confirmation email as the flight did not even register on the British Airways App. My replacement flight was from Heathrow so I had to make my way all the way across London (at my own expense) to get that flight which then ended up being delayed by 1 hour!

Craig Cutts,"London Heathrow to Amsterdam, check in on line and bag drop quick and easy, used Galleries North Lounge at T5. It was fairly busy but able to find a seat.

Having used the same route 2 weeks previously in economy, I must say for the difference in fare I feel British Airways have really missed a trick! Seats are just the same, the meal nothing special added to the change in the Executive club Avious accrual.

Seats are too cramped, compared to other airlines, no storage space apart from a small draw to store a laptop. A plastic privacy screen is all that separated me from the person in the aisle seat and that had to be lowered and raised when cabin crew served meals and drinks. When the aisle seat was made into flat bed, I had to climb over person to use bathroom etc. This could be a problem for less mobile passengers.

Clive Drake,"There are so many poor reviews here for British Airways, and I am just about to add another one. The return trip started in the shared lounge at Pisa. Its comfortable enough - but forget it if you are hungry. There is no food to snack on - just a few bags of crisps, nuts and sealed croissants. Booze choice is okay. Quite why, in Italy of all places, a platter of mixed meats, cheeses and typical antipasti cannot be provided - probably costing about £50 a day, is a mystery. British Airways don't care. No airbridge so a trudge to the plane. It was an ex BMI A319 and given they ceased trading three years ago one would think that the internal software could be changed to show British Airways branding and not BMI; very strange. Old BA Club Europe. Tired seats. FAs were fine. Food mediocre. Funny thing was the cabin smelt of a rather tasty ""meaty"" sort of meal. As we took off I was starving and full of optimism. All we got was a miserable afternoon tea; dried sandwiches, scones and jam. I compensated my gloom with a few gin and tonics. I asked myself, is this ""worth it"" - the extra for the product. What you get I suppose is a toilet for 12/14 passengers, compared with two toilets between 120 or so.  Wider seats (no extra legroom).  A meal over economy but not by much,  glasses to drink from rather than plastic beakers and a faster exit from the plane,  a few extra AVIOS points - that's it basically! Not a lot. Anyway we left 10 minutes early and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Nice smooth flight but I could have had that on Ryanair.

Whereas lounges are great and the staff is almost nice, the flight attendants sometimes are unfriendly. On this flight one flight attendant hit me twice with his cabin trolley and did not even excuse himself. The aircraft and the seats in Premium Economy are quite good including food and drinks.  But the worst with BA is customer support and help with problems. On my outbound flight from PHL to LHR I had a problem with reserving a seat. Although it was shown as free in the map (no bassinet!) I was not able to select it. First time calling the customer support I was told this is a technical error. Second time the lady told me that this is not bookable as this is next to a bassinet. Then one day later is was reserved. I called again and they told me that I was too late. Any hint on my two other calls was answered with ""that's your problem. You have a seat what is the problem?"". I mean at least she is right but the attitude is extremely bad and maybe there is a reason why I want to have this seat.

W Sardar,"I recently travelled British Airways from Phoenix to London Heathrow. This is my 3rd time I have flown this route onboard one of the Boeing 747-400 and I must say British Airways have got to either fully upgrade their B747 fleet or retire the aircraft. The seats are far too cramped and not comfortable, the in flight entertainment had to be rebooted several times as they stopped working or didn't work at all, the heat in the cabin was unbearable at times and very uncomfortable. The only plus points were crew who were very attentiveand willing to help and the food wasn't too bad. I am aware that around 18 Boeing 747's are getting refitted but by the look of it unfortunately the B747 on the Phoenix route is not, and for me as the route I travel, causes me concern and has me wondering if I will travel with BA again.  Not everyone can afford to fly business or first but that doesn't mean that we give up on the right to have a little space to move, seats that don't feel like they are going to cripple you, have an entertainment system that works and has a better selection of movies/tv shows/music.

P Hilliard,"These British Airways flights were undoubtedly the worst we've ever had to South Africa in ten years of travelling there. The seats were narrow, lumpy and incredibly uncomfortable especially for a long haul journey. I thought initially that we were unlucky and got broken or faulty seats on our outward journey, but they were just as bad on the return journey. To add insult to injury, we'd selected and paid for seats of our preference, but when we got to the airport for our return journey we were told the seats were gone, and simply told we would have to apply for a refund. The worst aspect of the flight however, was the heat. The aircraft was oppressively hot and stuffy for hours on the way from Johannesburg to London. Many passengers complained but the crew could apparently do nothing because the air conditioning system appeared too old to regulate the temperature. Also the entertainment system had to be switched off and rebooted several times because many passengers' consoles were not working. There were passengers who had to do without entertainment for the entire 10 hour flight. These aircraft are not fit for flying and should have been retired a decade ago. Pity the poor crew who have to work on these clapped-out aircraft every day. We've been travelling to South Africa several times a year for the past decade and this was our first time travelling with British Airways. Clearly it will also be our last.

R Simon,"Vienna to London Heathrow return in September 2015, both flights in Economy on an A320. Crew pleasant but not doing more than absolutely required. A snack and drinks were served on both legs. This time the sandwich consisted of a mini pastrami and cheese sandwich and a mini black currant bun. Edible, but not BA´s best sandwich offering.  Additional drinks were served on request. Both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. While the seat are slightly better than the Recaro slim seats, I miss the older more comfortable seats with better leg room. I did not really realize that BA has changed the rules recently and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). Also, if one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR75 at the airport or EUR35 on line.  The final fare with BA can be substantially higher than the initial price quote - the additional charges are displayed during the booking process and if one commits to checking luggage during the booking process, the charges are lower. With the exception of a free drink and sandwich, British Airways Economy product is now pretty much a low-cost airline product. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checking luggage. While VIE-LHR was on time, the return LHR-VIE leg was delayed for one hour. After a timely boarding the full plane was waiting for the departure, but then the flight deck announced that they are waiting for some cargo to be loaded and they missed their assigned slot, which meant waiting an hour for a new slot. So, basically BA inconvenienced a whole plane of passengers to load some delayed cargo. Flying with hand baggage only, I used web check-in for both flights which worked fine. Boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE. The Lounge as such is acceptable (small and mostly packed), but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. The selection seems to be more or less the same in all lounges in VIE. BA Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 a comfortable oasis amid a busy airport and food and drinks selection was better than VIE. Wine selection was nice. BA still uses T3 for its flights to VIE, which I consider a huge benefit over using T5, which tends to be a mess for passengers. While I stopped flying British Airways Business in Europe they BA changed Business seating to Economy seats with no additional legroom, I see no valid reason to pay any surcharge for this product, but I still consider BA one of the better options for Economy flights in Europe. However their new low-cost airline concept also means that the times when I was willing to pay higher prices just for flying with BA over easyJet or Austrian on this route are unfortunately over.",6.0,10.0,"""pretty much a low-cost airline""",2015-10-01,A320,Business,Economy Class,VIE to LHR,2015-09,yes,VIE , LHR

You can see the individuals are trying, but it seems the business just doesn't want them to be able to deliver that world class First service they owned for all those years. I can only assume it's about cost cutting as their planes are so dated and falling to bits now. Especially when you compare it other airlines like Cathay or American Airlines. In all honesty, if you can fly an alternate airline, you'll probably get a better first class cabin and cheaper - I'd recommend it. Also, how does this airline not have Wifi on their long haul yet?

I have recently flown with a heap of other Oneworld Airlines and feel British Airways service slipping rapidly. The crew are smiles when you enter the cabin, but when you are served, the smiles seem a bit absent, and the service, I would describe as passable. Compared with Cathay Pacific where crew will approach the Premier Status customers with a full welcome (regardless of class) and give that extra special attention making you feel of value, this is absent with British Airways. Still the flight was short and pleasant enough. I got Exit seat and the legroom was very good, not very good in the standard economy seat and being 1.87m its a squeeze.

Kerry Kenton-Clarke,"London City to Granada. I've flown with BA a lot over the years, most recently in Business and First and have, until recently, always had a favourable opinion of them. I recently used Avios to take a short break to Granada with my brother. My normal choice for such a short flight would have been economy because I don't believe the extra cost (whether this be actual money or Avios) justifies the perceived benefits. Regrettably, no economy reward seats were available so I opted for Club Europe. The only real benefit on this particular route was the increased baggage allowance, although this was of no real use for a 3 to 4 day trip! So what did we get for our 'business' flights no lounge at City Airport, no fast track at City Airport, a 'holding pen' prior to boarding with everyone standing around in a small room and no priority boarding. Seats in Club Europe are identical to those in Economy. The breakfast going out was terrible (burnt food along with dried out toast and croissant). The lunch (if you can call it that) coming back was also terrible - a cold salad dish with dried out rolls accompanied by vinegary wine. No lounge at Granada, No fast track at Granada, coupled with a single check-in desk most of the time and long queues I complained to BA about this - the initial response was that Club Europe left the middle seat free to allow more room. Whoever responded obviously didn't even think to check the aircraft, as there is no middle seat on the Embraer - it's a 2x2 configuration for the whole aircraft. After some considerable persistence on my part, a partial refund of 5,000 Avios each was provided by British Airways. I recently had the choice of flying Club World to Hawaii (BA to LAX and then AA to HNL) but given the fact that British Airways Club World can be quite claustrophobic, ultimately decided to try out Qatar Airways new business class to Thailand (via Doha) - by all accounts their business class is comparable to British Airways first class.

Mark Williams,"LHR-PHX 16 Sept. Last few times I've flown British Airways, I'd been forced to consider BA as a discount airline that doesn't deserve its 4 star rating, and I was not looking forward to this flight. We had awful seats at the back of a very full plane so asked at bag drop about upgrades. Paid £230 each to go up to WTP (a bargain when added to the price we paid for our seats in coach) and it was worth it! Does anyone know why we check in online or go to a self-serve kiost but still have to go to bag drop to pretty much go through the check in process again? Boarding went as usual, smiley welcome aboard and to our seats. This aircraft had WTP immediately behind First. Good leg room, comfortable seat, small cabin of its own. A small amenity pack is provided, although most of the stuff in it is inferior and hardly worth having. Only one FA worked our cabin but he was friendly and efficient and the lack of more staff was not noticable. Drinks trolley and lunch menus then food served. Lunch with 2 options, china plates, real cutlery, napkins etc.  Food was very good, even though only one option left by time we were served. Had beef, which was tasty and tender and well presented. A snack box was passed out a few hours later and dinner served 2 hours before landing. Interestingly, dinner was from economy. Foil dish, plastic cutlery, paper napkins. Given the price of WTP ticket, would have expected better then that.  Only one juice/water round but FAs were in the galley and happy to get whatever you wanted (until we drank tham out of bubbles!). Being an older plane, the IFE was ancient with a very small screen that had grid lines showing and a barely adequate movie selection. Noise cancelling headset was not the best and hurt my ears. IFE was only a minor irritation, as flight was scheduled 10 hours 45 and I was more interested in comfort, which WTP provided. Only real gripe is the tray table. It folds out of the seat arm as a drinks tray, then unfolds to a full tray. Problem is, drinks slide off when in small mode and you have to brace the full tray on your knees to stop your dinner sliding off. British Airways is relying on its past reputation rather than providing a good product these days and I avoid them if I can because of that. I didn't think I would be saying this but I enjoyed this flight and it was probably the best BA flight I've had.

Tom Lewis,"British Airways from Heathrow to Vancouver outbound, Toronto-Heathrow inbound, both on rather ancient Boeing 747-400. Both flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule and the fare was competitive. Check-in and bag delivery was fine at all 3 airports. The aircraft interiors were shabby at best, seats uncomfortable, IFE hopeless, food awful. Cabin crew were mixed, one or two fairly pleasant but most going about their duties in a perfunctory way. One male cabin crew member was so overweight and sweating profusely, it was astounding that he could still be allowed to fly.

Ian Smith,"Glasgow to Cape Town via Heathrow with British Airways, and the short flight from Glasgow to Heathrow was fine, exit row seats with plenty of room, although the catering was a bit bizarre, a drink and a packet of crisps. The flight to Cape Town was however a different story. The Boeing 747-400 used was well past a major refurbishment both inside and out. The economy class seating was very squashed together with virtually no room to move, and I'm only 5'10 tall. The seat back entertainment screens must be first generation, tiny screen with a grid of lines on it, I've seen smart phones with bigger screens! The crew in our section were a bit perfunctory in their duties, apart from one female who smiled and chatted with and I quote ""her guests"" and who made the flight a bit more bearable. The food on offer was standard economy class fare, it filled a gap, just. The flight time for BA0059 is 11.5 hours, so British Airways really need to improve the inflight quality of their long haul flights in terms of a bit more room, and better catering for economy class passengers, who do make up the majority of people on board, not the premium passengers.

What I cannot understand is why they still have not updated their Club World seating after so many years. Even the US carriers offer superior seating these days. I don't get it - new British Airways plane but same old seats. While they are fully flat and I slept well, the main issues are having to step over other passengers as there is no direct aisle access and a lack of storage space and cubby holes around the seat. The cabin crew were mature, professional, and the CSD introduced himself during the flight and seemed genuine. Catering seems to have improved - I chose the beef for dinner and instead of the usual overcooked lump in a casserole dish it was cooked well and plated similar to what all first rate airlines do in Business class these days.

Heard one say to a young man ""you should have got up earlier"". Only when we got restless did they open the fence to let us go to an idle check in operator. Then the ""priority"" security process was nonsense, just as slow as elsewhere. Staff on board excellent. On return journey I checked in online as usual. Changed our seats to the final row. Got on board to find the row had no window. Flight too full to move elsewhere. Partner a very nervous flyer and had a horrible journey back, felt he was in a coffin, and heart flutter returned next day due to stress of the journey. All made worse by 30 min delay on departure and a further 30 min delay before being allowed to land at LHR. Next day I contacted British Airways customer services online to ask why there was no indication at all on the aircraft seat plan that row 25 on A319 had no window. No response at all apart from automated ""we're busy but will get back to you asap"". A week later I sent the same response, with original complaint number, again online. No response at all, not even the automated one. I'm left feeling that British Airways is nowRyanair, though even they have been trying to improve their service and image recently. The days of British Airways as a classic British airline, with good service and professionalism went with the sale of it to other nations. It is not what it appears. We also noted that cabin staff in economy could barely cope with a full cabin. Instead of a trolley starting at either end, there was only one with two staff.

Neil Hopkins,"Las Vegas to London Heathrow with British Airways. What we were expecting and what we got are two separate things.  We boarded the aircraft on time, and were greeted at the doorway, but once inside, the cabin crew were more interested in themselves and chatting - no help anywhere! We settled into our seats, which were narrow and very cramped, and the heat in the cabin was very uncomfortable to the point that the majority of the passengers were fanning themselves down with safety cards. The service commenced once the flight was underway and free drinks were offered, and if you fancied a beer the only choice was lager or lite lager. The meal commenced shortly after and my wife had ordered a lactose free meal which she was given - or so she thought until she looked closely and everything contained dairy products. This was changed when it was brought to the attention the of the crew, and looking back I think she would have been better with the wrong choice that was given, and suffered the consequences as it looked unappetising, bland and who knows what it was. No vegetables, no meat. The rest of the meals were served (or should I say thrown at us) offering pasta or chicken. The attitude from the cabin crew was very poor and some were rude and arrogant. For the majority of the flight the cabin crew were invisible. One  of the screens in the seatback wasn't working so this was rectified 30 minutes after the cabin crew being told - why aren't these things checked prior to boarding? The space you get in economy is abysmal, the person in front of me put his seat back and was nearly lying on me, the leg room is shocking and the seats uncomfortable. My son couldn't eat his meal until the person in front put the seat up as he couldn't see it. The cabin crew should make an announcement when meals are served for passengers to upright the seats out of courtesy to the people behind or tell people when they're serving meals - no they don't, as it would be too much of an effort for them.

The aircraft are tired, food is poor, even the new gourmet business class food. British Airways management should try the breakfast porridge with salt and blueberries! What about the afternoon tea sandwiches? Yuk. Toilets often out of service and on my last 6 flights at least 1 of the toilets has been out of service. The last flight BA117 on Wednesday 2 September 2015 the power failed meaning all the seats in my section of business class had to be manually positioned. The in-flight entertainment system stopped. The staff were great, but frankly all the company is doing is putting staff in a difficult position. In 2015 my company will have spent £120k on travel to and from London and New York. Too much money for such a mediocre service, aircraft that are many years beyond proper serviceability and a management team focused on shareholder profit not customer satisfaction. What a fall from grace. In August I flew Singapore Airlines London to Melbourne. What a difference in aircraft quality, customer service experience and value for money. Please British Airways, sort yourselves out. Letters to Keith Williams or Willie Walsh are ignored or intercepted by staff. Lots of promises and little or no action.

Alan Thompson,"Compared to the likes of EVA Air or Qatar Airways, British Airways Club World is by far the poor relation. Flew from Glasgow to New York via LHR, the seats have zero storage apart from the small drawer at floor level. It is astonishing that for the money they charge, you have to step over the legs of the person on your outside, especially if you accidentally trip and land on top of them. Food was satisfactory although a small bacon roll for breakfast was again a poor show. AVOD was also satisfactory. Apart from the flat bed, this just really doesn't have a premium feel about it.

Clive Drake,"London Heathrow to Dubai in British Airways First Class. The trip got off to a good start with the Concorde lounge at Terminal 5. Very comfortable and private, however showing signs of wear and tear. Needs a bit of a refurb. Boarding was announced and we promptly left, however only just made it to the gate. (Very odd, but I am no fan of the trains to the strange satellite terminals for boarding.) The plane was a very old refurbished Boeing 747-400. Quite why BA hangs on to these gas guzzlers is a mystery. I estimate the plane, over its life so far, has done about 90 million miles (enough to get to the moon). Much criticism has been said about cramming so many First suites into the nose of the plane, and I can say that is fully justified. It was a day flight so not worried about sleeping, but if it were a night flight as a tall (but not overweight) man I would struggle to get comfortable. It’s like a coffin and storage space for personal effects not worth a light. A cabin crew told me they will hang on to the newer Boeing 747-400s for another 5-10 years. If so, this is truly unbelievable. Given the Emirates competition on this route, their fantastic suites and they always serve caviar, one does wonder if the sales and marketing people at British Airways have a clue how to entice customers to the overall experience. There is so much criticism of British Airways on this site, one wonders why they don’t listen. It can only be perceived as arrogance. Food was fine. Very nice mezza, nice soup and spicy Middle Eastern style chicken; not bad at all. Champagne very basic and Krug has long vanished from British Airways routes. Cabin crew were terrific – faultless.

David Passmore,"On the upper deck on BA 282 (Aug 31st), although the equipment is relatively new, once you are in those hideous seats, you wouldn't be aware of what aircraft you are on. Squeezing as many ying yang seats onto an aircraft does not constitute a premium cabin experience. British Airways missed a great opportunity to enhance their club world product, but while other carriers improved their cabins, BA seem content in leading the race to the bottom. The crew on this flight looked as though they did mot wish to be on duty and one in particular was really obnoxious to a child. The child's parents were certainly mare tolerant than I would have been. Crew turned a blind eye to two passengers who decided to retain their luggage from the overhead lockers while the aircraft was still climbing and the seat belt signs were still illuminated. Once the food was served, crew were nowhere to be seen until breakfast was served. Due to the awful food served on this route on a previous trip, I ate before boarding so cannot comment what the offerings were on this sector. The 'Club Kitchen' is a complete waste of time. I did attempt to have a snack from the club kitchen during the overnight flight (after negotiating the outstretched legs of a sleeping passenger) but the unlabeled sandwiches were chilled out of their existence and were inedible.

Marcus Hoellrich,"I can confirm what has been reported earlier about British Airways long haul flights. Our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same. The TV screen was almost impossible to watch because of the distorted picture and the seats felt like on an IKEA couch from the 1970's. The usual food choice of ""pasta or chicken"" was reduced to chicken only. On top of that we were 24hrs delayed due to bad servicing of one of the engines which needed a spare part - only available in the UK. Disaster at the check-in counter when 400 travellers were asking for accomodation - British Airways had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hours of unnecessary waiting in the queue. Hotel vouchers given for hotels that do not exist! We had to find a room for 4 (two small kids) on our own at almost midnight.

Michael Slater,"Thoroughly disappointed with this supposed legacy airline. Having been delayed for an hour on my British Airways connecting flight to LHR and stuck overnight at a Heathrow hotel I was looking forward to getting going on the morning flight. Reality check. This aircraft is old and decrepit and was built in the 80s, it should have been retired long ago. A quick Google search shows that this aircraft makes up the majority of BA's longhaul fleet. The seats are so small and narrow that you are constantly playing elbow hockey with the people on either side of you. I am 5ft 8 and weigh 70kg so how a larger person might survive is beyond me. Everything is old and looks it too. Even the staff. The seats are worn to the point that you can feel every piece of the metal frame beneath. In fact the lady seated in front of me complained to the cabin crew because she could feel the miniature Tropicana bottle I had put the seat pocket. Even the safety animation video looks like it was made as a school IT project by 11 year olds. Staff are cold and unfriendly, it would seem that their contracts forbid smiling of any kind. The inflight entertainment screens are smaller than a regular smartphone and have large visible pixels, it is a struggle to actually see what is being displayed. They are running on brand image only and even then there's only fumes left in tank.

The seatback screen was tiny but selection of entertainment was good. The picture quality was rather poor. The black mark was the pathetic breakfast - croissant was inedible. Partly frozen, tasteless and it seemed like most of the folk seated nearby did not even open the plastic wrapper. Two cups of tea and a muesli bar was ample. My wife and I were travelling on different itineraries with British Airways and this was one flight we shared. I asked 3 times for the agent to link the booking, which she did.

David Hookway,"My wife and I flew from Toronto to London (return) using BA Business Class in July of this year. This was part of a ""trip of a lifetime"" we had planned to the UK. We have never flown business class, so decided to spend the big dollars for a return trip. I am not sure if it was worth it at all! Toronto to London was an overnight flight, London to Toronto an afternoon flight.  Ease of booking online was very good, Customer Service on phone was poor (obviously outsourced so a language barrier!). Check in at Toronto was average, nothing above check in at any other counter. Lounge at Toronto very good, great food, drinks, service, facilities. Aircraft cabin with average state of wear Seats - center rear facing seats. Comfortable but lacking any type of space (the lie flat bed was good) Cabin crew were on auto pilot - not rude but certainly not great,  Food was average. The return trip (Heathrow Terminal 5) to Toronto was not really any better. The business class lounge at Heathrow was not good. Lousy food, looks very worn, very busy, travelers sleeping across multiple seats, bathrooms were average .I would have rather taken my chances in the regular lounge area or gone into one of the many sit down restaurants. The distance from the main concourse (after security) to the lounge is quite long and the distance to your gate (especially if it is in the B or C sections) is a great distance, and involves a train ride! Same seat on the return trip, so again average. Food, service etc all average. Overall, we were not impressed with British Airways Business, and would not use them again (consider Air Canada or another airline).

Ste Morris,"I didn't really know what to expect from this flight, it had been a couple of years since my last BA flight (Gatwick to Nice in that case) we were on our way to Lyon Airport from the city centre and noticed the flight had only just departed London. Upon arrival at the airport we found it to be delayed by 40 minutes. With little information given as to why. When we finally got round to boarding there was no organisation, a bit like every man for himself. What amused me was that the captain came on over the PA and encouraged passengers to hurry and take their seats as we had only 9 minutes to keep our slot. Safe to say because of the lack of organisation we missed our slot and we sat on the aircraft for another 50 minutes while we awaited a new slot. The captain kept us informed as best he could, the cabin crew showed no effort at all. They showed no will to actually be there, they didn't check on passengers bearing in mind it was 39°C outside and this was affecting the temperature inside the aircraft. Once we took off the service seemed rushed, I wasn't able to get any food at the airport so was hoping for something that would keep me full on the journey back, no so much a pitiful Ham and Cheese bun thing and a drink. There was no personal touch to it. As we were approaching Heathrow all we could hear from the rear galley (we were in the back row) was the two crew complaining about their hours.

Also the slimmer seats on the aircraft, in this case a rather old A319, are much less comfortable and roomy. I find it quite tight and I am not especially tall at 6ft. The cabin crew were not particularly attentive but friendly. They barely bothered with the passengers onboard even though the flight was nearly empty.

I fly the LHR-PHX-LHR route on a monthly basis and although I've spoken to colleagues about changing carrier, as BA offers the only direct route into Phoenix I have stuck with them. But where to begin? The 747-400s used are ageing, shabby and tired, if they were your old horse they'd have been taken to the knacker's yard years ago. Throughout the aircraft the seating is uncomfortable, space cramped and onboard facilities lacking and limited. The AVOD in economy and the premium variant is restarted with almost comical regularity, the screens are smaller than most of us have fitted in our car so you are either squinting or just unable to see the movie you are trying to watch. When the person in front reclines the screen is almost forced into your face such is the limited legroom. Catering is just awful in the economy cabins and only marginally better in business, although I see the airline is getting around this now by allowing the the privilege of paying for a meal upgrade. One word of caution here - if you are upgraded your meal stays behind despite you paying for it. All in all BA is slipping against the competition and delays are common place as to be expected, LHR lounges are in need of a complete makeover and it's a rarity to get more than a couple of cabin staff who seem happy in their work. I've one more BA flight to go and then it's adieu from me, but then given how they so sparingly issue tier points now it's not like I'm going to miss them.",3.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-08-28,Boeing 747-400,Business,Economy Class,LHR to PHX,2015-08,no,LHR , PHX

BA do not seem to have much in the way of contingency plans and particularly where terminal 5 at Heathrow is concerned it takes very little weather to throw the whole place into confusion. At all points information was lacking or contradictory. I cannot decide if they lie or are so inept that they do not communicate with each other. Eg our internal flight home was showing as being subject to big delays for hours online. When we arrived at the gate the delay was announced as a sudden crew issue. A new thing this year seemed to be to bring out the captain to speak to passengers - maybe we were supposed to be charmed. This happened both at Heathrow and Boston.

At 18.20hrs the announcement came that the flight was not boarding and passengers should wait to be escorted to the arrivals areas to collect baggage. The chaos then started. People close to the boarding desks sought to find out information and the possibility of alternative flights (which were fully booked). After about 40 minutes passengers were told to go to arrivals where BA staff would be there to assist. Got to arrivals, nobody was there to even tell passengers which carousel to go to. A series of late announcements then informed passengers to collect luggage and go to the arrivals area to seek hotel vouchers. Nobody was directing passengers at each stage. Passengers were congregating under an electronic sign that said South African Airways domestic transfers to collect vouchers. The line slinked back into the arrivals area. Only two service agents were dealing with all passengers. Chaotic scenes. No line for families or premium passengers. In the end no vouchers were given and free for all to just know which hotel to go to. No clear announcements given at any stage to passengers. All airlines have issues which mean a plane will be cancelled - it is how the issue is dealt with that shows professionalism and a basic duty of care to passengers. In this case there was nobody in charge, nobody undertaking line management and nobody providing one source of information. A true shambles. Passengers arrived at the hotel not knowing when the aircraft would leave (scheduled to leave 27 hrs after original departure) or what the real problem was (rumours only). Flying Club and having a BA Gold Card (with Gold List status) meant nothing.",1.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-08-18,A380,Business,Business Class,Johannesburg to London Heathrow,2015-08,no,Johannesburg , London Heathrow

BA was able to process my payment for upgrading seats, but once they took my money, the website stopped working and no longer let me select seats or check-in. BA is more expensive than Virgin Atlantic, and delivers worse service. Virgin allows passengers to pick their seats on booking, BA charges passengers for that option.

Ian Eaton,"Flight was picked because it got us from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to Newcastle, UK in a reasonable amount of time. What BA failed to inform anyone was that despite advertising the flight from RUH to LHR as landing at 5.25am BST at LHR is that planes cannot land at LHR before 6am. So once landed and they taxied to the apron we had little time to get through transit to catch the Newcastle flight. We made it and got to Newcastle only to find that our two suitcases were there but my golf bag which I had paid for did not make that flight. It did make the next flight to Newcastle but I had already had to set off to make an appointment some 170 miles from Newcastle. It took 3 days for my golf bag to arrive at where I was staying. Not one word of apology from BA. The seats on the flights were ok, service of crew satisfactory, the headsets didn't work from RUH to LHR and I tried three sets.

The way BA handled is pathetic with no proper communication regarding status of bags. I called several times and had to go to the airport twice. There was much confusion with the BA people claiming 2 of the tags issued were not found in their system so no claim was made for these missing bags. No follow up though I was promised they will call me later that day on the 10th.

Aircraft B777 full flight, probably around 100 business class passengers so too many to know by name and no effort was made by cabin crew. Seats cramped (as expected). Did not eat on board as had dined in the lounge. A few drinks, part of a film then tried to get some sleep on the 7 hour flight.

John Simonyan,"Where shall I start, 4 hours delay or the days without my luggage? I came to Nassau for my wedding, me, my wife and our 3 best friends. We arrived to Nassau on Tuesday with 4 hours delay, but the most annoying part just begun. Our wedding was on Friday, me and my wife were without luggage until Thursday, due to hell knows what was going on in BA, my best mate, didn't receive his luggage for a week, and on my wedding he was best man, so I had to give him cloths to wear. We had to change the organized wedding date, to another, 3 days later. He received his luggage on a last day of his staying in Nassau. From the first day arrival, BA was contacting us and saying same thing, the luggage is coming next day, and that was for me 3 days, my friend 1 week. When I received my bag, they lost my key, that I gave in airport in Nassau to BA person, I signed the contract that I agree when my luggage arrive they can open it and check it. They lost my key and I had to cut my bag to eventually get my cloths. The plane was old, but pretty well maintained. Me and my wife slept half flight, but when we woke up, the cabin crew told us that we can't have warm food anymore - we had 3 hours to fly, and  we were hungry.

David Stones,"I fly 95% for pleasure and often take advantage of Avios reward flights coupled with BA Amex companion offers and with careful planning, we seem to always find something in business for my wife and I and then pay for our 6 yr old boy, which given his age, has to include the half term and summer holiday periods. My best experience recently was flying the to Las Vegas on an ageing B747, but this was overcome by the decision to offer us the option of sitting in the ""Old"" First Cabin, which my wife and I took full advantage of and was very comfortable, quiet and private. We did the same on the way back, but because of an aircraft change we found ourselves flying in a refurbished New First which was the icing on the cake (all of this for just £2000 each in the BA sale). This type of service can also be repeated on short haul with excellent food for an airline. My only gripes are the use of tiny A319's on the Paphos route which is too small a plane for such a long route and I'm not a big fan of the decision to reduce legroom in the new Club Europe, however the exclusion of the middle seat does give enough room for you legs.

Walter Williams,"I was booked in First Class (as a paying passenger) on this airline but went to check in and was told they had oversold the flight. I was bumped onto a Qantas flight leaving half an hour later (via Dubai) which may have been a blessing in disguise as Qantas was outstanding - see my seperate review. I chose the flight with BA via Singapore for timing reasons for sleep - and for the use of the First Class arrivals lounge at Heathrow as I had a flight onto Berlin several hours later. By going via Dubai it threw my sleep out and no arrivals lounge to use. I had to change terminals and beg my way into a standard BA lounge - which was no mean feat. What really annoyed me about this was BA's attitude to the whole thing. Firstly, I am of the opinion that no plane should be oversold, least of all First Class. I was after some compensation for the inconvenience they caused - and eventually they offered me a £200 voucher after weeks of back and forth emails. I had a Business Class return ticket to Sydney and was after an upgrade as compensation - not unreasonable, otherwise I wouldn't have asked for it. The whole experience of dealing with BA in regard to this was awful. For a fare paying First Class passenger to be bumped off a flight and be treated so disrespectfully after the event is a poor reflection on their level of professionalism.

Welcomed by friendly staff, good selection of sandwiches, cheeses, snacks and alcohol, and happily provided a glass of champagne on request. Loved the little whisky nook! Priority boarding was honoured and had row 1 seating on this former BMI A319. Good welcome by staff and adequate legroom. First Officer was informative and we took off ahead of schedule. For a 1 hour flight the crew provided a good service of snacks (crisps and biscuits) and a full bar excluding champagne (no CE service on domestic routes). Seats and toilets were clean and we landed ahead of schedule.

The flight to Moscow began with a long bus journey (longer than the one already endured at Gatwick) around Heathrow tarmac to the waiting aircraft.

The aircraft was too large for the small boarding lounge, but plenty of shops and restaurants to pass the short time I had to wait. I was seated to the rear of the lower deck, in a window seat where the aircraft narrows from 3 seats to 2, so I had a good amount of extra space beside and in front of my seat. The crew were pleasant, some appeared a little intimidated by some Russian passengers when they were asking for drinks or indicating their meal choice. I noticed from their name badges that many of them spoke languages in addition to English, but I didn't see any who spoke Russian. After drinks service the meal was served, including a vegetarian choice. This was in contrast to the outbound overnight flight in my other review. The flight crew updated regularly. I liked the use of the Boeing 747 on the route, although internally it is beginning to appear dated.  At Heathrow, multiple boarding card, passport and security checks combine to produce an awkward process. The flight to Glasgow on an A321. The cabin crew gave an impression of efficiency and friendliness. A short flight with time for a drink and small snack. On arrival at Glasgow, I found a wheel missing from my 4-wheeled trolley case, rendering it unusable.

Paul Ackroyd,"I selected British Airways on this trip, ahead of Air China who I've used a few times from Beijing. What a mistake, because despite some of the problems with Chinese airlines, they offer a far superior service to British Airways. The cabin, seats etc were dirty and claustrophobic on this British Airways flight, and I bitterly regret my patriotism in selected them for this trip. Food is basically on a par with many Asian airlines Economy class standards, and you need to be very cautious about believing any of the marketing rubbish that British Airways provide in different areas. This is not a premium experience, and was a true waste of money. Staff were on another planet as far as service was concerned - abrupt, unsmiling and intent on getting service over as quickly as possible, before they retired to gossip loudly in the galley. Using the call button was a waste of time midflight, I guess they were all resting by then. I know that on Air China the wine may be served rather warm, a cold beer is hard to get, and staff language skills are limited to standard phrases, but their staff are cheerful, enthusiastic to serve customers - and their business seats a lot more comfortable. The British Airways motto of flying to serve should be challenged in court as a blatant misrepresentation.

Michelle Bennett,"From the lack of customer service both in their call centre and from their cabin crew through to not being seated next to my husband on a 24 hour flight, I am thoroughly disappointed with British Airways. My husband and I travelled on separate bookings and were flying back from London to Sydney together. I phoned British Airways 3 days before my flight from London to ask them to link our booking numbers so we would be seated on the flight together. I was informed they could link the numbers but not guarantee we would be seated next to each other. However if I wanted to buy my seat in advance then this would be guaranteed. I was not giving this money-grabbing airline another opportunity to take more money from me so I refused this option. My husband tweeted the airline and received two more replies stating they could not help with this. When online check in opened my husband and I were allocated seats 10 rows apart and could not change this. Phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check-in staff could assist. Arriving at Heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate. The staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together. The only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped, who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the Singapore-Sydney leg. This woman did not even work for British Airways but was the most helpful. Not one British Airways staff member apologised for this. The cabin crew on both flights clearly did not enjoy working in Economy. A request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight (I was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane).

Daniel Wilkie,"I am a Silver Card Holder, work in aviation and fly around 3-4 times a week. Up to 2 months ago I was loyal to BA as it is an 'English Airline with English Values' but this loyalty was unfounded. My main issue now with BA is the age and quality of the aircraft they are now flying. On frequent trips to Dubai with BA on a 30+ year old 747-400, it seems that BA has removed all cabin quality standards and is waiting to send the aircraft to the graveyard. The seats were old and falling apart, not one thing on this aircraft worked correctly. The arm rests were damaged and the cushions flattened. The inflight entertainment was shambolic, the screens did not work correctly and were in need of either overhaul or an upgrade about 10 years ago. On short haul flights, in business (LHR-MUN), the 'upgraded cabin' is a bit of a con. The seats are lightweight. Uncomfortable seat foam with less leg room, the faux leather is horrible to sit on and does not let you breath especially when you are sitting on the aircraft without AC on. My worst experience was trying to fly back to Munich from London. It was an old A320. As we took off the pilot had to do an emergency landing. On landing, they say that they were trying to fix the problem and kept us on board. This I feel was a lie as it so happened that they let the 100 + passengers off as the last flight to London departed. We then had to stand around for 2 Hours trying to get rescheduled onto the next day flight and hotel accommodation which even though they knew we were coming had not prepared anything. Next day we flew home on the aircraft that we had originally taken off in. I would not recommend BA at present, even the new A380 I flew on to LA had so many faults and badly thought through. I will miss the easy access of Terminal 5 and lounges that I earned through loyalty as many other customers do.

Once onboard I discoverd that the interior was worn and the seats very uncomfortable. The in-flight entertainment or the VOD (video on demand) system apeared to be VHS and was broken for my seat, one of the cabin crew had to do a reset it which took over ten minutes. The screen was very pixelated and the sound did not work very well which meant that watching the in-flight entertainment was more tiring than not watching it. The food was average but seemed to match the aircraft as it was dull and tasteless. As this was an overnight flight I expected to be able to get somewhat more than a 30 min nap which was interupted, any sleep was not possible due to the fact that there was 5 infants in the world traveller cabin all of which at least 3 were shrieking at any given time. The Boeing 777 should not be still used on long haul flights as it does not live up to the standards of BA's Airbus A380's or Boeing 747 flights.

T Allen,"What has happened to BA in recent years? It has been a long time since I ventured onto their long haul flights, and after this trip I will steer very clear again and stay with Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines. Airport service in Narita is always good - because it is not BA providing the service. But for the rest of the trip, simply awful. The seats (that were introduced back in the era of the only BA boss to improve things) are cramped, claustrophobic and very unpleasant on a long haul flight. Because of the seat design, there is an economy class meal style service rather than the table service that most of the ""good"" airlines now offer in Business class. The cabin staff were frankly laughable, sadly with the exception of a charming and attentive Japanese FA. British Airways is trading off a very distant reputation, and it seems that most British customers select them simply because they are British - anyone that travels a reasonable amount will know that BA is now well down the quality list, and it is about time Skytrax downgraded them to 3-Star Airline maximum - they do not meet 4-Star. BA markets itself as this slick, British style, when the reality is that they are a substandard member of oneworld now, and should be avoided if you have a proper choice of airline - many UK companies and UK departments stipulate BA as a No 1 choice, and frankly they are throwing their money down the pan. If you're proud to be British, I would recommend you give BA a wake-up call and avoid this very poor airline until they wake up and improve standards. As a closing point, I recently travelled China Southern Airlines on my outbound sector to Guangzhou, and they are streets ahead of BA in almost every element, excepting some language skills.",3.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-08-03,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,Tokyo Narita to London,2015-07,no,Tokyo Narita , London

John Bradley,"Short trip to Vienna in BA Economy Class from Terminal 3. New A320 cabin on the flight out - looks nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hours. Other than the cheap, highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. Staff service minimal - they served breakfast and collected the leftovers, basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight - not even an additional beverage service. I'm sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. Return a couple of days later, older aircraft but clean. Same indifferent service, similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink. This wasn't a cheap ticket (over 200GBP) - I know BA are competing with low cost airlines in Europe but when are they going to realise they aren't a low cost airline? A bit of chat from the staff and a couple of extra coffees would have made all difference to how I felt leaving those flights.

B Stauffer,"British Airways Business Class product has not really changed over the last 15 years, and they are now far behind competition in seat comfort (half of the passengers must still fly facing backwards) and entertainment. What once made BA a great airline was the cabin crew who treated their passengers like guests. Unfortunately, they are slowly retiring and replaced by younger employees who could care or less about high revenue passengers. On this particular flight, the cabin was half full, but the crew rushed the service to an extent I have never seen before: the pre-dinner drinks were served, and less than 5 minutes later, I was served the first course. I did not even start the salad when the plate was taken away and I was presented with a beef fillet that was totally overcooked. Ten minutes later, the trays were taken away, and the lights dimmed. We did not see the crew again for the next 9 hours, and no water or juice were ever served. Unfortunately BA has the only non-stop flight between Cape Town and London, but next time I will fly Emirates via Dubai even if that means adding 4 hours to the trip.",2.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-07-31,Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,Cape Town to London,2015-07,no,Cape Town , London
Michaël Steiner,"This was my return flight of my trip in the USA. From Europe to the USA we had an Airbus A380 which was modern and quite enjoyable to fly. My return flight was on a Boeing 747. The aircraft was quite old with seats which weren't so comfortable but at least fully OK. The flight was good, cabin crew were friendly, sometimes  absent in the cabin and not very happy when you asked them something.  The food was OK, not gastronomic but acceptable in an economy class. We had delays of 35 minutes by landing, so the flight were quite on time, though that the longest delay was due of an engine problem. I recommend British Airways even for short flights (if you book early and fares not too high) than for longer ones. One reason more is that connections in Heathrow are easy when you have two BA flights, transfer done in 35mins.",7.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-07-29,Boeing 747 and A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Zurich via LHR,2015-07,yes,San Francisco , Zurich via LHR
Eamon Callan,"I have flown in business class with BA on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. If you get an indifferent crew - which, in my experience, is not far off half the time - they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible, go to sleep and not bother them any more. Once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and leave you to ask for everything. I have never had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example Emirates, EVA or Lan Chile, quite the opposite. Anyway, BA were offering a special price to upgrade (cash only) to first on my Vancouver-Heathrow flight. I thought I'd try it. It was a waste of money. The first sign of trouble was the fact that I was not welcomed or addressed by name - an absolute must I think. Then the (male, and they tend to be the worst on BA, I am sorry to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy - he just doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in a personal manner. The wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when I asked a specific question (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know the answer. I eat slowly and was still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. I thought 'Oh no, surely not in first'. Well, I was wrong. I was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. After that, unbelievably, I was abandoned again and, in protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. I asked to speak to the cabin services director (female, delighful manner) who was full of apologies, of course, and off I went back to my seat. When I was finally given coffee, the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that BA don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do, I couldn't believe my ears. As for the cabin, being in the nose of the 747,I felt cramped. The mood-changing lighting doesn't compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats and carpet. The in-light entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. I know this reads like a demolition job on BA but I have made no exaggerations. I really think Willie Walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. He'd find out for himself. I want BA to be the best and it simply isn't. Lastly, my experience of the hit and miss service of BA business class is shared by every other person I have ever mentioned it to. If you're flying BA stay in business class, you're not missing anything.",2.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-07-28,Boeing 747-400,Solo Leisure,First Class,Vancouver to Heathrow,2015-06,no,Vancouver , Heathrow
Dave Houlihan,"This review is written due to what I feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business.

A Gibson,"Quick online check-in and boarding passes with the BA mobile APP. It is so easy to use and definitely helps you to get rid of those annoying loose bits of paper from your cabin bags. Manchester Airport Terminal 3 is bursting at the seams during the summer holiday mornings. There's a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn't take too long at all. The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This helps stop the queuing in the aisles onboard to get to your seat. We were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew. The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I'm 5ft 11""). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action. We were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap, orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for such a short flight and definitely helps set BA apart from the competition. The flight arrived into Terminal 5 a few minutes ahead of schedule and outside the UK Arrivals area less than ten minutes later.",10.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-07-27,A321,Business,Economy Class,MAN-LHR,2015-07,yes,MAN,LHR
Linda Wilson,"I am a very frequent long haul traveller and although I will often choose the Asian carriers (e.g. Singapore Airlines, JAL, Cathay) over British Airways, being based in London means that I do often fly with BA. I find BA's long haul business class offering though innovative when it was launched in the 90s has now been way outclassed by many of its competitors. The seats don't quite lie flat (and it's not unusual to get a broken seat) and half the passengers have to go backwards and climb over other passengers to get out - I can't think of any other major airline that has this any more in business class. I am told by a BA contact that they considered changing the configuration for the A380s, but didn't in the end. Worst of all, I find the onboard service incredibly inconsistent - most often it's a little begrudging, occasionally it is excellent and sometimes it is downright awful. I was particularly annoyed at my customer service experience on a flight from LHR to Tokyo Haneda, when settling down in my seat, I looked down to find a dirty napkin, used earplugs and toothpick and significant quantities of broken glass around my feet (good job I hadn't taken my shoes off at this stage). My husband flagged down a member of cabin crew, who said she would come and clear it, but didn't. I flagged down the Cabin Services Director who did bring a dustpan and brush and said he would report it. Upon my return, I complained to BA. After three weeks, they deigned to reply, but it was on the lines of 'our cabins are always cleaned to the highest standards, we are sorry you didn't find this to your liking' - effectively implying that I was making a fuss over nothing.",3.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-07-27,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Tokyo,2015-07,no,London Heathrow , Tokyo

Inflight entertainment was alright, but do take note to always unplug the headset whenever you get out of your seat. It damages easily if it gets caught on something. I had to change 2 headsets because of that, because being in a aisle seat, you have to get off when someone wants to use the lavatory, thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get up from your seat. Service was alright. I requested for eye shades, and it came about 1hr later, crew must have forgotten about my request. I didn't pursue it as I thought I could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie. In terms of food, it was appalling and greasy. Overall, I will not say never again, but given a choice, I'd look out for Singapore Airlines first, then the big 3 Gulf carriers.

We had front row seats 10A and 10B, 10A window seat is reverse facing and 10B is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats were very comfortable and we got a solid 8 hours sleep. We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10A gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. Very attentive and cheery cabin crew, they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. The food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take off and during flight, wine selections ok.

At check-in I was under 30kg but over the 23kg derisory BA limit. Was asked for £65 more but declined. When I quoted Thai Airways 30kg limit I was invited to buy a ticket with them. So I had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap items to get my boarding pass. On the plane I had to sit next to a very fat man (not BAs fault) and the food was disgusting. Some rubber chicken with four strips of gravy-sodden potato wedges. No vegetables. Second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge. No salad, yoghurt or other goodies. Between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. IFE had the smallest screen I have ever seen, and a poor choice of films.

When I pay for a business seat I expect that seat section will be free and I won't be charged for another $147. The b-class is not uncomfortable, just configured weirdly, with little storage space near the seat. The FAs have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window, which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them.

Alan Spencer,"The booking of our flights was straightforward. However, when we have paid to sit next to each other, and paid for the opportunity to book seats in advance, you would expect the seating plan for the aircraft to clearly show where all the toilets and galleys are so that as the paying customer we would have a choice as to whether to is near them particularly on a long haul flight, on this occasion British Airways failed miserably. The plane was new and the seats were comfortable and spacious enough, not the upper deck in ecconomy. However being seated next to the toilets was not the best location, particularly as we had pre booked the seats online. The service was excellent and the staff helpful and happy to be there. The gluten free meals that we ordered were provided although the breakfast could have been more substantial especially after an 11 hour flight.

John Duffus,"Having encouraged passengers to check-in online and save it staff time and money, what does BA do? It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum. Business class bag drop at 08:30 at Heathrow had mostly empty desks and a queue resulting in a quite unacceptable wait of more than 15 minutes. Then having raced through security, there was the almost inevitable flight delay, only this time the 40-minute delay to the incoming aircraft was a result, we were told, of someone forgetting to tow the plane on to the stand from another part of the airport! With flights taking off to the west, there was yet another 20 minutes delay during taxiing. Only crisps or a couple of sweet biscuits were offered along with drinks.

My wife left her handbag on board the plane when we arrived at Heathrow, and the BA flight attendant personally travelled from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5 to hand deliver it back to her. If you know the huge distance between terminal 3 and 5 at Heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. That exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these days, so BA get a 100% customer care rating from my wife and I. Snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. Aircraft was clean, however the only negative was the Business Class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that BA should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey. They were standard Economy Class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front. To convert these to Business Class seats all they did was put a fancy clip-in style armrest to make the row configuration 2 seats instead of 3.",9.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-07-10,A320,Family Leisure,Business Class,Helsinki to London,2015-06,yes,Helsinki , London

Fair enough if they want to charge for pre-booking of seats, but at least they should allow selection at check-in time in line with their direct competitors on the same route (Aer Lingus). I have also found the service (food, drinks etc) extremely poor for the fare charged, even for the short sector.

The passenger next to me was repeatedly woken as food was handed over or spilt on him. After the service the polite cabin crew disappeared. Only one bottle of water all flight. The food was tasteless, overcooked and the presentation with fast food condiments reminded me of fast food chain. At the price this is the worst product in the skies. Seat was broken and IFE clunky.

Once again the cabin was too warm and I saw no passengers using their blankets.

So no air was being pumped in to the cabin and the engines could not be started! For some reason it then took half an hour to locate one that did actually work.

John Duffus,"Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems. 100 minutes prior to departure, 2 check in desks were open - 1 business, 1 economy. As a BA Silver card holder, I joined the business queue. First one lady had considerably too much baggage. The arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. Then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. Not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight, others were way too large. After 20 more minutes I asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. This was not possible, I was told. Eventually another economy desk opened; yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. Finally after more than 40 minutes, someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all! Looking forward to a drink in the lounge, I then discover there is no lounge airside. As for the LHR-ORD flight, I have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. To board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31"" was a major shock. This is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. The worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. The meal was OK and the IFE had a decent selection of movies. But overall, the flight was hugely uncomfortable.

John Gray,"It appears BA continues to adopt a “do as little as possible” for this route, presumably due to their monopoly. The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up.

Check-in was fine, and cabin staff attentive, food average - but I do have an issue with space. The 747 fuselage tapers at the back - there's not enough room for 3-4-3 seating, and rows 51 on have 2-4-2 configuration. Rows 49/50 don't have enough room for 3-4-3 seating either, but BA do it anyway by sneakily making the outer seats narrower than the rest. I endured a 9 hour night flight in one of these horrible seats, my back was twisted and sore for weeks after. This is just not acceptable for a long-haul flight, especially at night - BA charges extra for seats identified as having more room, by the same principle these seats should be advertised as having less room and cash-back offered for anyone prepared to accept them (small children, perhaps).",3.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-06-20,B747-400 / A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Berlin via London,2015-04,no,Vancouver , Berlin via London

I was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning Sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning I was to fly - the whole point of this trip was so I could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding, saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin. BA staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here.

It was unfortunate that my travelling companion's bag didn't make it on the outward journey, particularly as our break was only 5 days long and we had pre-booked travelling plans for the day after arrival.",8.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-06-17,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to Milan Malpensa,2015-06,yes,LHR , Milan Malpensa
Richard Vines,"I flew from Seoul to London, business class and was surprised how much better the food was than in first. It was interesting and enjoyable and attractively presented. If only BA would abandon the bizarre seat configuration in business, it would be very good. The service was OK, if a bit inattentive, but it is embarrassing to have the attendants slide down the screen every time you need anything. You find your face inches away from that of a stranger. Fortunately, I now know which seats to pick to avoid climbing over my neighbour to reach the aisle.",6.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-06-16,boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Seoul to London,2015-06,yes,Seoul , London
J Harrison,"Ended up on a 25-year-old 747, the second-oldest in BA's fleet, and boy did it show. The cabin was seriously dated and in need of a good renovation, but I guess this aircraft will be retiring any day soon. The outbound flight was on a nicely retrofitted 777 with comfortable spacious chairs and excellent, clear and larger IFE screen. The screens on this 747 were tiny and and very poor resolution by comparison. Nevertheless, the service was usual good BA standard: courteous and efficient, with decent enough food (better than in past years, when revolting soggy pasta seemed to be the norm). Despite the ancient and not-up-to-standard aircraft, the flight was pleasant enough.",6.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-06-14,B747-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to YYZ,2015-05,yes,LHR , YYZ
Steve Gatenby,"We were boarded quickly but suffered a weather delay of over an hour because of localised thunderstorms. Throughout this time, the cockpit crew kept passengers updated and after about 30 mins water/juice were offered before being advised that we would soon be cleared to depart. The cabin was clean and the crew friendly and polite with apologies about the delay. Breakfast snack just ok but only a short flight. In my view BA in general do short haul well, but really need to improve their long haul product.",9.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-06-13,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,LGW to VCE,2015-06,yes,LGW , VCE
Andrew Gascoyne,"Terrible. Flight time is well over 2 hours. Seating is like Ryanair, but we are talking BA Club Europe. Which genius decided that 30 inch is sufficient for premium passengers? No idea what to do with my legs. It's impossible to use my laptop. This is not business class. Very uncomfortable flight, especially for the money I paid.

James Williamson,"28th May 2015, LHR-DEN, B747, Seat 29A.  Paid £55 extra for Legroom seat which was good though the width is very narrow.  Lady in seat next to me kept fidgeting And her arm kept twitching into mine the whole flight which was annoying.  Flight was on time and cabin crew were all very friendly.  Food also was pretty good for economy.  747 is really showing her age now, though the cabin was clean, tidy and in good condition, it was old in style and very noisy.  The entertainment system is also quite long in the tooth with a small, blurry, screen.  Pretty good flight though.",8.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-06-12,B747,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR-DEN,2015-05,yes,LHR,DEN
James Williamson,"9/6/15, ORD-LHR, 777-300, Club World, Seat 13b.  Had booked as World Traveler Plus but was upgraded pretty close to departure. This meant I did not have any time to get a meal before hand and the meal on board was both small and not very good.  Would have been better with the economy mean I think. Breakfast was pretty poor as well with
several items not given out. Other than that the crew were excellent and very attentive.  The seat was full lie flat though pretty narrow I thought compared to other carriers Business class. Entertainment system was also very good and up to date.",9.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-06-12,777-300,Solo Leisure,Business Class,ORD-LHR,2015-06,yes,ORD,LHR
James Williamson,"10/6/15, LHR-GLA, A321, Seat 9A.  Was able to choose this seat in advance which has plenty of legroom as no seat in front.  Flight was pretty full.  Cabin crew were all extremely friendly and helpful welcoming every passenger individually.  Flight was delayed by difficulty in storing the silly amount of carry on baggage people brought on board.  Some stuff was obviously way bigger than the allowed size.  It took ages to get it all sorted which was ridiculous, however the crew kept smiling though it all.  Again new configuration seating which I found pretty comfortable.  Drink and snack was served as usual.  Landed nearly 30 mins late to discover my baggage had not made it from GRR which was quite annoying.  Overall good flight though.",9.0,10.0,British Airways customer review,2015-06-12,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR-GLA,2015-06,yes,LHR,GLA
